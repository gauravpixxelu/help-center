								<p className="hdng-18">To succeed in business – no matter what business you are in – you are going to need a great strategy. If you look around, you are certainly going to see that you have competition in the market, but that’s okay. You don’t have to be the only business in your market in order to succeed – you just have to be the best</p>
								<img src="images/Strategy-model.jpg" alt="" />
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Lafley and Martin’s Five-Step Strategy Model</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Where most people think that they need to have the best product or service in the world in order to win, success in business is actually as much about strategy as it is about the actual product that is being sold. Of course, it helps to have a great product, but you need an excellent strategy to match.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">If you would like to develop a winning strategy for your own business, consider using Lafley and Martin’s Five-Step Strategy Model. This is a relatively new model which was published in a 2013 book, making it one of the most-modern strategy models in business. By working through the five steps that are included in this model, you should emerge with a clear concept of how your business is going to be run from this day forward.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">What Is Our Winning Aspiration ?</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Quite simply, this is the goal of the organization. Of course, it should be a bit more specific than just stating that you would like to ‘make money’. All for-profit businesses want to make money, so that doesn’t really help you get anywhere. What it is that you are going to do in order to make that money? Are you trying to dominate a specific market, or are you just looking for a piece of a big market? It is important to be specific even at this top level, as your answers to this question will influence decisions you make later on.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The best way to think about this question is to picture what success would look like in the future. If your organization is being successful five years from now, what would that look like? You should be optimistic, but realistic at the same time. For instance, if you sell some form of technology, you likely aren’t going to topple the major players in the tech game, but that doesn’t mean you can’t hit your own marks for success.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Where Will We Play ?</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Once you know what it will look like to win, you then need to decide exactly where you are going to ‘play’ in order to achieve that victory. This question demands that you identify both the markets and the customers that you are going to pursue. For some businesses, such as those that sell directly to consumers, the answers to this question will be easy. For example, if you produce a small product that is easy to ship, and you are selling direct to consumers, you will likely set up a website in addition to selling on other established e-commerce sites. However, for businesses that are going to sell to distributors or other intermediaries, identifying specific markets may take a bit more time and effort.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">How Will We Win ? </h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Now that you know where you are going to be competing in the market, the next step to deal with is the strategy that you are going to use to make sure you come out on top. You are going to face competition in whatever slice of the market you have decided to enter, so you will need to think long and hard about how you can position your product or service to stand out from the rest. If you take this step for granted, you will likely find that your competition remains a step ahead for years to come.</p>
								<img src="images/develop-usp.jpg" alt="" />
								<p className="hdng-16">You don’t necessarily have to have a complex strategy in place at this level to come out on top – but it does need to be a good strategy that has a real chance to succeed. You could plan on winning the market based on lower cost, higher quality, faster turnaround times, or some combination of those three. Business is very simple when you boil it down to the basic level – consumers want good products and services for fair prices. Focus on those tenets and you will be headed in the right direction.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">What Capabilities Must We Have in Place to Win ? </h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">This is the infrastructure that supports the plans you have developed. In order to enter the selected markets, and win in those markets, you will need a specific set of capabilities in place within your organization. What are you going to need to do in order to meet your goals at higher strategy levels ?</p>
								<img src="images/capabilities.jpg" alt="" />
								<p className="hdng-16">For instance, if you have decided that you are going to win through offering lower prices, what capabilities to do you need in order to be able to sell your goods at a low price point? Without the capabilities necessary to meet your higher-level goals, the organization is destined to fail.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">What Management Systems Are Required to Support Our Choices ? </h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">All organizations are driven forward by people, even if there is plenty of technology in place within the company as well. Without good people working toward a common goal, everything else that you have done to this point will be wasted. This final step of the strategy process demands that you take the time and effort to build management teams which will be able to support the organizational goals and strategies that have been put into place.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">There is a lot to learn from using this model within your own organization, as it can help you to quickly create a top-down set of strategies that will keep your business moving in the proper direction for months and (hopefully) years to come. Businesses without specifically-outlined strategies tend to ‘float around’ until they are eventually knocked out by superior competition. Don’t let that happen to you. Use this five-step process to clearly define all of your strategies and look forward to a long and prosperous future.</p>

								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>If you don't make a difference, you don't matter.</li>
									<li>You can't make a difference to everyone.</li>
									<li>Strategy must enable your organisation to make a difference that matters to a critical mass of the "right" customers.</li>
									<li>Strategy connects the purpose and values of your organisation with those of its customers and other external stakeholders.</li>
									<li>It may be easy to clone a product, but it's impossible to clone a community. So a vital goal of strategy is to create and sustain a unique community.</li>
									<li>Purpose and values hold a community together, drive teams to seek their potential, and provide the context in which individuals will volunteer their imagination and spirit.</li>
									<li>Shared ideas lead to shared meaning. The more openly and honestly ideas are shared, the greater the level of trust will be, the more efforts will be aligned – and the more ideas will emerge.</li>
									<li>People value work that makes them feel valued. When they make strategy, they matter. And they own the results, so effective execution is more likely.</li>
									<li>Strategic management is conversation. It informs, focuses attention and effort, triggers fresh insights, lights up the imagination, energizes people, and inspires performance.</li>
									<li>Strategic conversation provides a context for personal and group learning. Your message must be compelling, simple, clear, and believable, or you won't sell it. It must also be complex and challenging, or no one will buy it. And it must be repeated with relentless consistency.</li>

							<h2 className="hdng">Defining Culture</h2>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-18">Competing Values Framework</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The OCAI is based on the Competing Values Framework: one of the most used and useful frameworks in business. Over 10,000 companies used it. It is well-researched and validated but compact with six aspects reliably representing an organization's culture. The OCAI is a quick culture tool where you distribute 100 points between four “Competing Values.”</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">These four Competing Values correspond with four types of organizational culture. Every organization has its own mix of these four types of organizational culture.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The <b>Competing Values Framework (CVF)</b> emerged from research to identify the organizational effectiveness criteria. The criteria that were found to make a difference are the dimensions internal-external and stability-flexibility.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">Internal-External dimension</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">An organization might have an internal orientation; focusing inward on development, collaboration, integration of activities, coordination. Or it might have an external orientation; looking at the market, what’s possible with the latest technology, what competitors are doing, what customers want, and it could diversify activities as a result.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Both internal and external attention are needed to be successful in the long run - but depending on their environment an organization will have a dominant preference. An agile, volatile market will evoke an external orientation whereas a stable environment will allow for an internal focus.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">Where Will We Play?</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Once you know what it will look like to win, you then need to decide exactly where you are going to ‘play’ in order to achieve that victory. This question demands that you identify both the markets and the customers that you are going to pursue. For some businesses, such as those that sell directly to consumers, the answers to this question will be easy. For example, if you produce a small product that is easy to ship, and you are selling direct to consumers, you will likely set up a website in addition to selling on other established e-commerce sites. However, for businesses that are going to sell to distributors or other intermediaries, identifying specific markets may take a bit more time and effort.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Note the “competing” nature of the values: you have to choose whether you look inside or outside - you cannot do both at the same time.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<div className="row">
									<div className="col-md-5">
										<img src="/images/culture-1.jpg" alt="" />
									</div>
									<div className="col-md-7">
										<h5 className="hdng-h5">Stability-Flexibility dimension</h5>
										<p className="hdng-16">The second defining dimension is the focus on stability or flexibility — organizations that prefer to organize for stability value clear structures, planning, budgets, and reliability. They assume that reality can be known and controlled. Organizations that organize with flexibility assume the opposite: you can never predict and control everything. They prefer a flexible attitude and organization to adapt quickly to changing circumstances - focusing more on people and activities than on structure, procedures, and plans.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">The “competing values” nature of stability and flexibility prevents you from doing both at the same time. Organizations can spend their money, attention, and time only once, so they tend to emphasize certain values. Quinn and Cameron found that flexible organizations are most effective, which sometimes leads to contradictory behavior. The “best” organizations use all four value sets when necessary.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">A culture type works best in the activities domain that aligns with its values. In the health care sector, for instance, we often see clan culture.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16"><b>Beware:</b> there is no ultimate “best” organizational culture prescribed by the Competing Values Framework. The model is descriptive. In a specific domain or market, one culture type might fit better than another, and this is for the organization to decide. "When would be at our best?"</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">When you map those two polarities in a 2x2 matrix, you see four culture types emerge.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">There is a lot to learn from using this model within your own organization, as it can help you to quickly create a top-down set of strategies that will keep your business moving in the proper direction for months and (hopefully) years to come. Businesses without specifically-outlined strategies tend to ‘float around’ until they are eventually knocked out by superior competition. Don’t let that happen to you.

							<h2 className="hdng">The OCAI</h2>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">The OCAI (© Kim Cameron) was carefully designed, tested, and validated. Respondents are asked to score six aspects of culture:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Dominant characteristics</li>
									<li>Organizational leadership</li>
									<li>Management of employees</li>
									<li>Organization glue</li>
									<li>Strategic emphases</li>
									<li>Criteria of success</li>
								</ul>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>For each aspect, they must divide 100 points over four statements.</b> They assign the most points to the statement that is most true, and the least or none to the statement that doesn't fit with their organization.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>The first round of scoring the six aspects yields a profile of the current culture.</b> Quinn and Cameron found that most organizations have developed a dominant culture style. An organization rarely has only one culture type. Often, the culture profile is a mix of the four organizational culture types.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>The second round focuses on the preferred organizational culture in the future.</b> The gap between these two profiles shows the desire for and direction of change.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>This way of scoring is deliberately designed.</b> By dividing 100 points over four statements, respondents have to weigh and choose in the Competing Values Framework. In reality, you can't have everything maximized at the same time. A Likert-scale would allow people to give all statements a 1 or a 5 - while this way of weighing points is more realistic.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The six aspects are based on extensive research. Adding more variables does not enhance the survey's validity. Hence, the survey is short and sweet while it yields a valid representation of culture. (If you want to know more about validity and reliability, please see the book by Cameron & Quinn: Diagnosing and Changing Organizational Culture).</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">By averaging all OCAI profiles, we can calculate a collective team or organization profile to get an overview of current and preferred culture. It can be interesting to compare the culture profiles of departments, locations, levels, or professions within one organization. In smaller teams, you could also compare the individual profiles.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>Why do organizations invest in organizational culture? Culture influences organizational performance, innovation, agility, engagement, and competitiveness.</b></p>
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>Summarized: a toxic culture decreases productivity with 40%, rude cultures damage productivity with $14,000 per employee per year, while an effective culture increases productivity with 20%, and a positive culture boosts results by 30-40%</b></p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Culture is often the reason why 70 percent of all mergers, acquisitions and organizational change projects fail.</p>

								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>A vision is an image of an ideal, unique, or desirable future state of a business. In practical terms, it is what the company wants to be. But it need not be confined to just a business. It could also describe a part of the organisation, a technology, a product or a culture</li>
									<li>A vision must operate on 3 levels. Analytical, Political and Emotional
										<br />- Analytical It appeals to the head. It is the outcome of the dispassionate analysis of the company's competitive position (costs, customer) vis-à-vis its competitors
										<br />- Emotional It will inspire by capturing the attention
										<br />- Political It must be a shared vision. The vision will only grow in fertile ground. So considerable energy will need to be spent mobilising people to re-see the world
									</li>
									<li>Generally speaking, a vision is specific enough to provide guidance and direction but vague enough to encourage initiative and remain relevant under changing conditions</li>
									<li>Vision provides focus by driving the organisation's strategy. Executive leaders work from a vision, not toward it. In other words, having shared the vision, they then figure out what they need to do to get there from here</li>

										<h5 className="hdng-h5">Criteria For An Effective Vision</h5>
										<ul className="site-ul">
											<li>Good visions incorporate strategic intent - which describes the where but not the how. They represent a discontinuity, a leap forward from the present to the future. They are based upon rigorous analytical and inspired examination of the current and anticipated future industry space in which the organisation competes. The ultimate test is to discover a sustainable source of competitive advantage.</li>
											<li>Good visions foster a long-term perspective, sometimes very long term - e.g. Time Warner's vision of interactive home entertainment, or Boeing's dreams of a Super Jumbo – these involve 10-20 year time frames.</li>
											<li>Good visions are competitive, they display an obsession with winning, e.g. 'Toyota's vision to beat Benz' and 'Pepsi's vision to beat Coke' and Canon's to beat Xerox.</li>
											<li>Good visions make market sense. They incorporate and then are based on a strong sense of the customers and other stakeholders that the organisation is trying to satisfy better than anyone else. Why should customers come to us? Why should the best staff work for us? Why should investors invest their money with us rather than elsewhere? Why would suppliers want to work with us?</li>
											<li>Good visions challenge and stretch people and give them assure of destiny. They foster risk-taking and experimentation. They empower and enable people to use their initiative and creativity. "THE FIRST THING TO DO IS TO TEACH PEOPLE TO FEEL THAT THE UNDERTAKING IS MANIFESTLY IMPORTANT AND NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE... THAT DRAWS OUT THE KINDS OF DRIVES THAT MAKE PEOPLE STRONG AND THAT PUTS THEM IN PURSUIT" Edwin H Land Founder of Polaroid</li>
											<li>Good visions inspire, motivate and lift people. A good vision grabs their attention. It is an animating picture.</li>
											<li>Good visions align people by providing a common identity and a shared sense of purpose, and in doing so should reduce internal friction, politicking and silo thinking.</li>
											<li>Good visions are shared visions.</li>

							<h2 className="hdng">Mission Statement</h2>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">What Is a Mission Statement of a Company?</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">A mission statement is a quick, succinct, memorable way of communicating a business or nonprofit’s unique purpose, function, and day-to-day goals to employees, clients, and other stakeholders. Mission statements are usually part of the business plan and often form part of the executive summary. Functioning in such capacities, mission statements can become the summation of a business strategy.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">What Is a Vision Statement?</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">A vision statement describes the ultimate goals and overarching purpose of a for-profit or nonprofit organization. A vision statement can serve as the cornerstone of strategic planning, providing an organization with direction and a general destination as well as defining its aspirations and values. Some say that the vision statement is what would remain if an organization could no longer produce a particular product or service.</p>

								<h5 className="hdng-h5">What Is the Difference Between a Mission Statement and a Vision Statement?</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">A mission statement describes the purpose and day-to-day effort of an organization. A vision statement describes an organization’s ultimate goal or future outcome. But the two work in tandem: A vision statement expresses what you ultimately want to achieve; a mission statement articulates what you will do to get there.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Together, the mission and vision statements provide direction and destination. (You outline the actual specifics of how to achieve a mission or vision when discussing goals and objectives.) The terms mission statement and vision statement are sometimes used interchangeably. In addition, people sometimes substitute the word mantra for the term mission statement. However, strictly speaking, a mantra refers to a value-loaded slogan.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Senior managers usually craft mission and vision statements for an organization. Managers at other levels may prepare mission or vision statements for specific departments or programs.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">What Are the Benefits of Mission and Vision Statements?</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Mission and vision statements chart a path for pursuing consistent quality and values (i.e., the things that will keep your core clients loyal over the years). A mission statement provides a guidepost for your employees, helping them to prioritize efforts, especially in times of crisis or indecision. A mission statement even gives them a way to promote your organization, including to future employees. A mission statement also becomes part of your branding and advertising, offering a quick, clear message for social media and other platforms. Therefore, it’s crucial to be precise in creating a message so that it isn’t vulnerable to interpretation. To craft an effective mission statement, you must view it as a living reference and not merely as a dusty printout on a cubicle wall.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Vision statements provide a common goal for all organization members and stakeholders. They supply a strategic framework for management and inspire employees, guiding them toward ethical operational decisions. Along with mission statements, vision statements also arm employees with a communication tool for reaching stakeholders outside the organization. But mission and vision statements aren’t just for the cafeteria and the boardroom — consider sharing them with clients and potential clients on social media, on packaging, on company swag, and elsewhere.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">Should Mission and Vision Statements Ever Change?</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Opinions vary widely on whether you should ever change mission or vision statements. Because both of these statements define an organization’s purpose, goals, culture, ethics, and decision-making framework, some experts say they should never change — they believe that although goals may change as you achieve them, mission and vision statements (if written properly) should remain the same. Other sources suggest that a mission statement should cover a limited time (two to 10 years), but that a vision statement, capturing the values of an organization, should remain the same. Still, others feel that a vision statement should change because, ideally, a company should ultimately achieve its long-term goals. Of course, if your organization undergoes radical changes, you will, undoubtedly, want to update either or both statements.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">What Needs to Be in a Mission Statement?</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">A mission statement should include a description of what your organization does, who your clients are, how you fulfill the company’s purpose, and what that purpose is. Ideally, in 30 seconds or less, your readers should understand what the organization offers customers, clients, employees, managers, owners, and potentially even the community and the planet. The statement should also communicate how the company achieves this.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">When crafting a mission statement, consider focusing on one or two key functions that can define the organization for employees, external stakeholders, and the public. A mission statement must be as short as possible while still being memorable and lucid in communicating your organization’s purpose. Some experts advise creating a two to six-word tagline, along with mission statements that are longer than 15 words. You may have a longer version for internal use and a shorter, customer-facing version. You may also have bullet points for each area of focus.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Once you’ve created a draft, ask yourself if it could apply to any business or non-profit or if it successfully captures your organization’s uniqueness. Define the essence of your organization and what makes it distinctive.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Buzzwords and Jargon to Cut from Your Mission and Vision Statements</p>
								<p className="hdng-18">Anybody can throw a lofty sentiment into a statement and then forget about it, or speak in obscure technical terms. Avoid these pitfalls and communicate your organization’s uniqueness directly and clearly. Eliminate phrases such as the following from your copy, and focus on concrete descriptions and aspirations:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>World class</li>
									<li>Superior customer service</li>
									<li>Be the best possible</li>
									<li>To maximize investor returns</li>
									<li>Satisfying</li>
									<li>Highly valued</li>
									<li>Look for other bloated, generic words and phrases that you can delete from your message.</li>
								</ul>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">How Do You Create an Effective Mission Statement?</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Depending on the nature of your organization, you may start researching and drafting a mission statement on your own or with a small group of team members. Remember that if you begin on your own, the development process should not continue in isolation. You’ll get the best result if you both include at least a few stakeholders in the drafting and review process and get buy-in from all those concerned. Here are steps for creating an effective mission statement</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Consider reviewing mission statements from organizations similar to yours to see what you like and what approaches are relevant for you.</p>
								<p className="hdng-18">Sit down and write or brainstorm as a group. Make a list of keywords and phrases that describe your organization. Or, you can do the following:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Write down your organization’s main purpose and function as well as its unique strengths. What is it that we do? What do we create? Why does it matter? How does it make a difference?</li>
									<li>List by type your organization’s main clients, or target buyer personas, internal or external. Detail what good the organization provides for each type of client.</li>
									<li>Describe how the organization treats employees, but only if you intend to pursue respectful and unique treatment.</li>
									<li>Describe the returns and advantages for business owners or non-profit manages and directors. What do you want to gain from the organization? Profits? A happy, productive workforce?</li>
									<li>List these characteristics in order of importance to your organization.</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16">Use these characteristics to create a short paragraph of no more than five or six sentences.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Get feedback on this paragraph, not only from employees and other internal stakeholders, but from suppliers, clients, and customers. Will your employees support this statement? Do outsiders believe it accurately reflects your organization?</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Consolidate your paragraphs into one concise statement. Although the ideal mission statement is 20 or fewer words, keep in mind that a longer message (anywhere from 50 to 250 words) is perfectly acceptable as long as it is impactful. Remember that you can always make it shorter and punchier at some point in the future.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Share the final product with everyone. Post it on the wall in the lobby. Tweet it. Add it to your webpage. Consider all the ways you can publish your new mission statement.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">As one final step, consider noting every place that your mission statement is published. That way, if you have to update your message, you can disseminate it everywhere simultaneously and include an explanation as to why.</p>

							<h2 className="hdng">Defining Values</h2>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">WHAT ARE CORPORATE VALUES AND WHY ARE THEY IMPORTANT ?</h5>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Values are statements that guide how the organisation will behave in pursuit of its vision</li>
									<li> If vision provides broad direction and the focus that drives the organisation's strategy , then values provide control by guiding implementation</li>
									<li>Values are important, because ultimately they help to define the organisation's non-negotiable behaviours. They help to define what is always expected under any circumstances and what is never acceptable under any circumstances</li>
									<li>Values also provide needed guidance in the grey areas because in today's world it is impossible either to foresee the dilemmas each individual decision maker will face or to come to the boss for ruling on every one of the exponentially increasing number of exceptions to rules</li>
									<li>Fundamental values enable people to make decisions in the face of uncertainty, consistent with the organisation' s intent</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>EXAMPLES OF COMPANY VALUES I.K.E.A.:</b> Humility, willpower, simplicity, thinking differently, avoiding bureaucracy, common sense, looking after the interests of the majority (of ordinary people)</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Reuters: Accuracy, freedom from bias, openness and accountability, innovation, speed, focus on customers, think global/local Ingram Micro: Teamwork, respect, accountability, integrity., innovation
									I.B.M.: Respect for the individual, excellence of customer service, excellence in operational performance</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Honda Motor Co.: Quality in all jobs; learn, think, analyse, evaluate and improve. Reliable products: on time with excellence and consistency. Better communications: listen, ask, speak up
									Microsoft: A long term approach (including strategic thinking and developing people), drive for immediate results, teamwork to get done in a complex environment; a demand for excellence; a passion for our products; continuous customer feedback</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">However, values in themselves are not enough. It's when values are translated into operating principles and into behaviours that they become real, demonstrable and measurable. This relationship can be visualised in the following Values-Behaviour Iceberg</p>
							</div>


							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Model THE VALUES BEHAVIOUR ICEBERG</h5>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Operating principles lie somewhere between values on the one hand (fundamental assumptions about what is good/bad or right/wrong) and rules on the other (narrow prescriptions or prescriptions). Operating principles can be any acceptable behaviours that stem from values and help guide behaviour without becoming narrowly prescriptive
										<img src="images/attitude-value.jpg" alt="" /></li>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">What is demand generation marketing?</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Demand generation is the process of creating awareness and demand for your products or services. It expands your audience, generates urgency, and clarifies your solution to transform interest into action.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Demand generation marketing is all about creating and accelerating a predictable pipeline for your sales team. First, it includes the initial campaigns so that your target audience opts in to your mailing list. Furthermore, it guides your audience to engage with your content, attend your events, and more. Demand gen marketing nurtures and engages your prospects, keeping your brand top of mind.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The goal is to move them through the buyer’s journey until they become a qualified lead. Then, you can transform them into a new customer with the perfect sales pitch.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Demand generation vs lead generation</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Demand generation aims to grow your audience by bringing new visitors to your website and introducing them to your solutions. On the other hand, lead generation aims to convert your audience into qualified leads. It’s a subtle distinction, so we wrote an entire article about demand generation vs lead generation to clarify the differences.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Key Points</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Demand Generation is the methodical process of turning strangers into prospects. Lead Generation is the strategic content that marketers build to nurture brand-aware prospects through the purchasing journey. Knowing the primary differences between demand gen and lead gen is vital to the success of your inbound marketing campaigns.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Within the last several years, there has been some confusion between the terms demand generation vs. lead generation. In fact, digital marketers have started to use these terms interchangeably, even arguing that there’s no need to make a distinction between the two. But, are these terms really all that interchangeable ? Does it matter what you call your targeted marketing strategies ?</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">What is demand generation ?</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Demand generation marketing is the process of creating awareness and demand for your products or services. It expands your audience, generates buzz, and drives traffic to transform interest into action.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">If you took the term at face value, you may think that demand generation (or demand gen) was only about generating some vague, unmeasurable interest — demand — in your product or service.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">In fact, demand generation is shorthand for the data-driven strategies marketers use to generate awareness and interest.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">To use a fishing analogy, demand generation is like tossing bait in the water to attract as many fish as possible to your boat.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">What is lead generation</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Lead generation describes the process of turning suspects (or prospects) who show interest in your product or service into bonafide customers.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Lead generation is the fruits of your demand generation marketing efforts. In other words, you got their attention through demand gen, now you’ll get their money through lead gen.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">If we continue with the fishing analogy, lead generation is like baiting your hook with the best lure to catch Chinook Salmon in Puget Sound.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">There are virtually endless methods a marketer can employ to convert those interested prospects into customers — especially when it comes to B2B lead generation. Choosing which types of content work best for your message depends on the overall goal of your campaign.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Stages of the funnel</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Demand gen feeds into lead generation. First, you need to build awareness and develop interest because not everyone is ready to opt-in or to convert immediately. In fact, especially at large enterprises, buyers are locked into vendor relationships that prevent them from looking for alternatives until set times.
									<img src="images/informational.jpg" alt="" /></p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Although an audience member may not be ready to talk with your sales team yet, they might want to watch your videos or read your blog posts. Consuming useful, entertaining and actionable content builds trust and brand awareness. So, when that audience member is ready to consider a purchase, you’ll already have a foot in the door!</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Lead generation is more focused on converting prospects into “qualified” status to initiate sales conversations with the brand.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Demand gen and lead gen overlap in certain areas. For example, if you offer product-focused webinars, driving registrations could be considered both. And when nurturing your database, both are applicable for building the relationship as you move them through the conversion funnel.</p>

							<h2 className="hdng">Work In Progress</h2>
							<p className="hdng-16">Work in Progress can have major impacts on the financial performance and position of a business, so understanding it and how to manage it is crucial for business performance.</p>
							<p className="hdng-16"> Simply put, Work in Progress is the value of inventory, labour and overhead of work that is in progress and has not been completed. Work in Progress is an Asset account in the chart of accounts because it is an asset the business owns.</p>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Work in Progress in Manufacturing</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">In manufacturing there are two meanings to the term Work in Progress, that while closely related, are quite different. If these differences are not made clear in the financials it can cause confusion.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">In the manufacturing process raw materials are assembled or processed into finished goods that are then sold. It is during the in-between stage part way through the manufacturing process where the meaning of the term Work in Progress can become blurred. It can be used to mean two things, that should be carefully distinguished.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Work in Progress is sometimes used to refer to inventory in stock that has been processed to a certain state in the manufacturing process and is awaiting further processing for finished goods inventory to be completed for sale. These are sub-assembly or semi finished products with their own item code that have an on hand quantity and can be counted. It is not uncommon for sub-assembly or semi finished components to be manufactured and held in stock waiting to be used in the manufacture of a number of finished goods products. This is not Work in Progress in the true sense of the term and simply refers to actual inventory in stock at an in between stage between raw materials and finished goods.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The true meaning of the term Work in Progress is the value of inventory, labour and overhead that have been consumed on production orders in progress for finished goods that have not yet been receipted into inventory. In this case the inventory is not in stock and cannot be counted as it has been consumed for use in the manufacturing process. This Work in Progress refers to the value of inventory, labour and overhead that is the cost of inventory currently being manufactured that is yet to be completed and receipted into stock. This is not part of on hand inventory value as the inventory has been taken out of stock and been consumed.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Both of these relate to the value of inventory assets owned by the business, but the key difference is whether it refers to inventory that is in stock and can be counted, or if it refers to inventory no longer in stock, (plus labour and overhead) that has been consumed on production orders currently in progress.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">It is important to distinguish between these as,</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Work in Progress inventory relates to actual inventory value that can be counted and has an on hand value that needs to be reconciled between the on hand inventory value report and the balance of Work in Progress Inventory general ledger account.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Work in Progress relates to the cost of inventory, labour and overhead consumed on open production orders in progress. Inventory that is work in progress cannot be counted as it is no longer in stock as a raw material or part of a manufactured item. The manufacturing work in progress value report needs to be reconciled with the balance of the manufacturing Work in Progress general ledger account.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">To avoid confusion between the two these should be two different general ledger codes with clearly distinguishable account descriptions. We recommend that;</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The General Ledger code for the value of inventory held in stock that is in an in-between state should have a description of “Sub-Assembly Inventory” or “Semi-Finished Inventory”.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The General Ledger code for the value of inventory, labour and overhead consumed on production orders in progress have a description of “Work in Progress”.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">This is important because the value of these accounts will be updated as the manufacturing process flows from raw materials inventory through to semi finished inventory through to finished goods inventory.</p>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Work in Progress for Jobs and Projects</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Work in Progress for jobs, whether they be for service, contacting or projects, is the value of inventory, labour and overhead that have been consumed on jobs in progress that have not yet been invoiced.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">While these are costs that have been incurred they are not a cost of sale until they are invoiced. Whether job costs should be counted as Work in Progress as an Asset, or Cost of Sales revolves around the matter of ownership and proper reporting in the Profit and Loss.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Job costs are not a cost of sale until the sale has been made and an invoice is been raised to the customer. Until then they are still owned by the business and are therefore an asset. When the job is invoiced to the customer the ownership of the inventory, labour and overhead used on the job passes to the customer and they become a Cost of Sale.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">It is only when the sale is recognised by the business that Work in Progress under Assets is posted to a Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) account under Cost of Sales. This is important so that the Profit and Loss report displays the true profit on jobs and reports the business’s true performance.</p>
								<img src="images/inventory.jpg" alt="" />
								<p className="hdng-16">Project jobs may be progressively invoiced over time and the value of Work in Progress for the job at the time the invoice is posted becomes Cost of Goods Sold to date. Varying proportions of job cost to income may result in fluctuations in the proportion of income and cost of goods sold in monthly Profit and Loss reporting. </p>
								<p className="hdng-16">For example, an invoice may be raised to the job before any work has commenced which would report 100% profit. After materials have been purchased to the job and work has commenced, it is possible that the second progress invoice may have a higher value of job costs than the income on the invoice. This could cause a loss in the Profit and Loss for that month even though the job overall shows a profit.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Some ERP systems, such as Ostendo, can smooth these fluctuations by how Work in Progress is posted to Cost of Goods Sold at the time of invoicing.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Another strategy for managing Work in Progress and Cost of Goods Sold is to hold materials purchased for jobs in inventory and issue them to the job as they are used. Ostendo can reserve stock in inventory for specific jobs.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">ost of Goods Sold (COGS) and Cost of Sales (COS)</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">It is important to understand the distinction between Cost of Sales and Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) as it relates to work in progress, inventory and job costs.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Cost of Sales is an account type in a chart of accounts along with Assets, Liabilities, Equity and Expenses. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) is a specific account or subset of accounts within Cost of Sales to record the cost of the sale of assets which is generated when they are invoiced, whether they be inventory in stock or work in progress on a job. In this way the Profit and Loss properly reports the profit of invoiced sales by providing a comparison of the income from invoices and cost of goods sold of those invoices.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The Cost of Sales will include general ledger accounts for other direct costs that relate to sales but are not costs linked to invoices such as rework, warranty costs, labour recoveries and payroll, to name a few. For example, while warranty work is a cost of sale, it is not cost of goods sold because it is not invoiced.</p>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">How is Work in Progress (WIP) Calculated</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">In an ERP system, inventory and work in progress values are perpetually being adjusted real time based on actual transactions. The current Work in Progress value of each production order or job can be reported on at any time and compared to the balance of the respective general ledger Work in Progress accounts.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Businesses without an ERP system use opening and closing Work in Progress journals each month to calculate the value of Work in Progress. This is a monthly financial calculation and is not real time, nor does it provide visibility on the Work in Progress value of specific production orders, jobs or projects.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Managing Work in Progress</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">It is important to manage work in progress so that it is kept at an appropriate level for the business.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">A higher value of work in progress than appropriate indicates that too much capital is tied up in unfinished work which in turn indicates that sales have not been realised and therefore profit has not been made. This directly impacts the business in terms of cashflow and profitability.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">While there are certain strategies for managing work in progress in the financials, the secret to managing work in progress lies in managing the revenue earning activities of the business which create the work in progress value in the financials.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">A higher level of work in progress than is appropriate is usually caused by operational issues such as;</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Data collection for job costing is not timely or inaccurate. There are inefficiencies in operational processes causing delays in completing production orders and jobs.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Production orders or jobs are started without all the required materials being available. This ties up inventory, labour and overhead on partially completed production orders or jobs that are on hold until the shortages of materials are replenished. This inventory, labour and overhead could have been utilised more effectively elsewhere.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">There are too many production orders released to the shop floor, or too many jobs started to be able to be completed in a timely manner with the available resources. This also ties up inventory, labour and overhead on partially completed production orders or jobs that are not being worked on.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Resources are under utilised or there is a lack of resource capacity which causes bottlenecks. These factors hold up production orders or jobs that are in progress from being completed.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Projects and jobs are late being invoiced. which means that work in progress value is not converted to cost of goods sold.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Improving planning, efficiencies and the utilisation of resources is the best way to manage work in progress and improve business performance. While Work in Progress can end up being a financial problem, its management very much lies at the coal face of business operations because what happens there creates the figures in the financials.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Using an integrated ERP system, such a Ostendo, with sound operational business processes will give you the information and visibility to manage work in progress and improve business performance</p>

							<h2 className="hdng">Differentiation Strategies</h2>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Cost versus Differentiation Focus</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>Cost Leadership</b></p>
								<p className="hdng-16">This is a common business strategy, and it is probably one that you have considered as you try to gain an edge on the competition. Cost leadership means you are going to lead the market in controlling costs in one way or another.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Cost Leadership</h5>
								<div className="row">
									<div className="col-md-6">
										<p className="hdng-16">Within this strategy, however, there are actually two ways you can go. One option is to offer your products at a lower cost than your competition, convincing consumers to pick your product simply because it is the least expensive choice on the shelves. On the other hand, you could opt to take a cost leadership strategy by producing your units for the lowest cost while still charging average prices for the goods. In this way, you will make a larger margin on each sale than will your competitors, so you can win in the long run even if you don’t sell significantly more units. In fact, you might even be able to win by selling less units if your profit margins are large enough.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">While it might seem like an easy choice to simply sell your products for the lowest possible price, you need to make sure that you can sustain that plan over the long run. For instance, if there is a larger player in this market, they may decide to undercut you for a period of time in order to run you out of business. Are you going to be able to keep up on the cost front? If not, you may need to pick a different strategy – or at least use a blend of strategies to carve out part of the market for yourself.</p>
									</div>
									<div className="col-md-6">
										<img src="images/lowest.jpg" alt="" />

								</div>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Differentiation</h5>
								<div className="row">
									<div className="col-md-6">
										<p className="hdng-16">In many ways, the differentiation strategy is exactly the opposite from the cost leadership option. With this plan, you are going to try to take over the market from a quality and functionality stand point, rather than simply trying to sell the least expensive item on the shelf.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">When you think about differentiation, you should be thinking about luxury brands. For instance, how does a luxury brand sell a purse for $500 or more when plenty of companies sell purses for $20? They convince the market that the quality and style that is offered by their product is worth the higher price. They have differentiated themselves from the lower cost options successfully, and they succeed as a result.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">Of course, it isn’t exactly easy to differentiate yourself from a quality or functionality stand point. Not only do you need to have a great product to offer, you also need to have a strong marketing plan to inform buyers about your item. When in doubt, consumers are going to default to the most affordable choice, so you need to be able to educate them about your product and everything that it can do. Without a great marketing plan and team, you will probably be left with a high priced item that is stuck on the shelves.</p>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Cost Focus</h5>
								<div className="row">
									<div className="col-md-6">
										<p className="hdng-16">The strategy in this part of the model is the same as the cost leadership concept, except you are going to be focused on one specific niche of the market. Rather than trying to sell to everyone, you are only going to be trying to sell to a small portion of the market that is focused on buying a unique product.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">While this strategy might not have the growth potential that you will find when dealing with the broader market, you will have the opportunity to become the major player within the niche – therefore securing your place for years to come. If you can get into a small niche with a product that is sold for less than any other, you will stand a great chance to succeed.</p>

								<div className="row">
									<div className="col-md-6">
										<p className="hdng-16">As you might imagine, the differentiation focus strategy is similar to cost focus, except you will work within a niche market while trying to stand out on a quality basis.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">You might not be the least expensive product available – in fact, you might be the most expensive product available – but that isn’t the point. As long as you can present consumers with something they are looking for, and you can justify your higher price, you may be able to grab a large share of the niche market.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">Porter’s Generic Strategies are a great way to think about the overall positioning of your business. You certainly don’t want to wander blindly into the market, hoping to get lucky and find a spot for your company to thrive.

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">Key accounting ratios may not be directly comparable between organizations that use different accounting methods. Most public organizations are required by law to use generally accepted accounting principles for their home countries, but private organizations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships generally have more freedom in reporting their accounts.</p>
								<img src="images/ratio.jpg" alt="" />
								<p className="hdng-16">This Key Financial Ratios Checklist details the key financial ratios you can use to help you interpret financial information. This Financial Ratio Formulas Checklist provides you with a list of the most popular financial ratios used to assess an organization's performance, solvency, profitability and investment potential. This Accounting Terminology Checklist outlines the terminology, concepts and conventions that are accepted within the accounting profession.</p>
							</div>


							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Interpreting Key Accounting Ratios</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Before you start your calculations you will need to make sure that the accounting treatments are the same when making comparisons. This is not only between the organizations you wish to compare but also for each year you wish to compare.</p>
								<p className="hdng-18">For example: An organization may change policy and decide:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>To capitalize research and development, holding it in the balance sheet as having a long-term value, or</li>
									<li>It may consider development costs as overheads as soon as they are incurred.</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16">Either treatment is perfectly reasonable, but comparing figures that have been arrived at in these two different ways would be pointless.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">When you need to make comparisons with global organizations it is important to remember that there is no international standard. How an organization calculates the summary data presented in all financial statements, as well as the terminology used, is not always consistent between organizations, industries, countries, and time periods.</p>
								<img src="images/national.jpg" alt="" />
								<p className="hdng-16">If you are trying to make global comparisons then you need to appreciate how operational differences within each industry or country can impact the validity of such a comparison. These differences include such things as seasonal conditions and traditional industry practices.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>For example:</b></p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Travel organizations operate under seasonal conditions that are mainly influenced by educational, religious, and constitutional holidays.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Automobile manufacturers in the United Kingdom have two annual registrations of new vehicles. These events cause two large peaks in car sales.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Predictable that people in these industries take them as read and rarely mention them. If you remain ignorant of such issues then your ratios will give you misleading information.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">For example:,</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">If you were investigating the European car industry then you would need to be aware that in the United Kingdom new vehicle sales peak in March and September. In fact, there are typically five times as many cars sold in March as in the previous month. If you did not allow for this, because you were not aware of the operational practices of the UK automotive industry, then some of your calculations could be meaningless.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Anyone who did not know about the sales variations in the UK's automotive industry could draw the wrong conclusion if they compared accounting ratios for February, March, and April. An automotive dealership would appear to have too much capital tied up in stock in February and far too little in April, when in fact this is simply a reflection of the market that it is operating in.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">This example illustrates why it is important to know something about how an organization operates and what the accepted practices are within that industry before drawing conclusions from key accounting ratios.

								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Key accounting ratios and solvency</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Profitability</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">These ratios measure the organization's use of its assets and control of its expenses to generate an acceptable rate of return. You can see if an organization is profitable simply by looking at an income statement, but you need to put that profit into perspective.</p>
								<p className="hdng-18">To do this you need to ask yourself:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Is the profit growing in proportion to the size of the organization ? </li>
									<li> Is the organization making as much profit on new sales as on existing sales ? </li>
									<li> Is the organization as profitable as others in the same sector ?</li>
								</ul>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">Performance</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Is the organization making the sort of profit that it has in the past or that others in the same sector are making? By looking at individual parts of the organization you can gain more insight into their profitability and efficiency.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">Investment</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">These ratios measure investor response to owning an organization's stock and also the cost of issuing stock. They are concerned with the return on investment for shareholders, and with the relationship between return and the value of an investment in an organization's shares.</p>
								<img src="images/comparing.jpg" alt="" />
								<p className="hdng-16">Trends are more revealing than one-off figures</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Remember that with most of these measures, the trend over time is often more revealing than one figure in isolation, and that comparisons between industries may not be very useful.</p>

								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Business Performance Ratios</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">There are several key accounting ratios that you can use to measure how an organization is performing in terms of both profitability and efficiency. This Key Financial Ratios Checklist details the key financial ratios you can use to help you interpret financial information. This Financial Ratio Formulas Checklist provides you with a list of the most popular financial ratios used to assess an organization's performance, solvency, profitability and investment potential.</p>
								<img src="images/stock.jpg" alt="" />
								<p className="hdng-16">Financial ratios for measuring performance</p>
								<p className="hdng-18">The ratios for measuring performance are:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Gearing</li>
									<li> Number of days credit granted</li>
									<li>Number of days credits taken</li>
									<li> Stock turnover</li>
									<li>Overheads as a percentage of turnover</li>
								</ul>
							</div>


							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-18">Gearing</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">This ratio looks at total borrowings divided by net worth of the business. Ideally, equity should be significantly higher than debt.</p>
								<img src="images/borrowing.jpg" alt="" />
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-18">How gearing is defined</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">If an organization's net worth (as shown in the balance sheet) was $60,000 and the borrowings came to $20,000 (made up of a bank loan and overdraft), then the borrowing ratio would be 1:3. In this example the equity is higher than its debt, but to understand the implications of this you would need to look at the expected gearing figure within the industry.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The purpose of this ratio is to compare the finance provided by lenders with the finance invested by shareholders. Generally speaking, banks do not like to see the amount of debt exceed the amount of equity. The ratio is usually expressed as a proportion (as in 1 to 1), although it can sometimes appear as a percentage. Gearing is said to be high when borrowing is high in relation to equity.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Number of Days Credit Granted</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">This ratio is used to measure the effectiveness of an organization's debt collection. It sets out the relationship between debtors and the sales that have been made on credit, and also shows how quickly customers are paying their invoices.</p>
								<img src="images/trade.jpg" alt="" />
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-18">Defining Number of Days Credit Granted</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The calculation for this ratio is trade debtors (this figure is taken from the balance sheet) divided by annual sales and then multiplied by 365 days. This ratio gives a rather broad-brush calculation.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">If you wanted to use a more detailed calculation you would look at how many days' turnover it took to make up the debtor total.</p>

								<p className="hdng-16"><b>For example:</b> An organization's</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Current debtors = $50,000c</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Sales in current month = $30,000</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Sales in previous month = $40,000</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The current debtors ($50,000) therefore represent all of the current month's sales ($30,000) and half of the previous month's sales ($20,000).</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Therefore the number of debtor days in this example is calculated by adding debtor days from the current month (31 days) and the previous month (30 days).</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Current month has 31 days Balance from previous month: $20k ÷ $40k x 30 days = 15 days Total debtor days = 31 days + 15 days = 46 days</p>
								<p className="hdng-18">If this figure began to increase you would need to look carefully at the debt collection routines of the organization. The sort of queries you would want answered are:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Are customers taking longer to pay ?</li>
									<li>Are a few customers building up a large debt ?</li>
								</ul>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">Either of these factors may give cause for concern because the older a debt becomes, the more likely it is to go bad.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The figure for trade debtors normally comes from the closing balance sheet and care should be taken that it is typical for the whole year. If sales taxes are included in this, they must be included in both the turnover figure and the trade debtors figure.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Number of Days Credit Taken This ratio sets out the number of days the organization takes to pay its suppliers. This is arguably less important than the 'debtor day' figure, as in this case the control over payment of suppliers is in the organization's own hands.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">When assessing another organization - for example one that is asking you for increased credit - this ratio can give a useful pointer as to whether the organization is operating within the accepted norms of the industry and (using historic data) whether or not it is taking increasingly longer to pay people.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">This ratio is calculated by dividing the figure for trade creditors by the annual purchases and then multiplying this answer by 365 days. The figure for trade creditors normally comes from the closing balance sheet and care should be taken that it is typical for the whole year</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">Defining Number of Days Credit Taken</p>
								<img src="images/ceo.jpg" alt="" />
								<p className="hdng-16">These calculations give a profile of the organization to potential suppliers looking for details about how efficiently the business is being run.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Stock Turnover</p>
								<p className="hdng-18">This ratio looks at how quickly the organization turns over stock into sales, and is therefore another good measure of efficiency. The higher the stock turned the more efficiently the business is being run. It is important that the terms are completely understood and there are no abnormal factors. Normally the definition of stock includes all of the following:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li> Finished goods</li>
									<li> Work in process</li>
									<li>Raw materials.</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16"> The stock value would usually be taken from the closing balance sheet but you need to consider if it is a typical figure. For example, an organization involved in the retail industry may have a seasonal influence on its operations so you may need to make allowance for this.</p>
								<img src="images/goods.jpg" alt="" />
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">Defining stock turnover</p>
								<p className="hdng-16"> The stock turnover ratio is calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold by the stock value.</p>
								<p className="hdng-18"><b>For example:</b></p>
								<p className="hdng-16">If the cost of goods sold is $500,000, and the average stock held during the year is $100,000</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Stock turnover is $500k ÷ $100k = 5</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16">Stock has been 'turned over' five times during the year.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">A quick turnover suggests that the organization is efficient in holding the minimum stock used within its operation. Again, this ratio is most informative when looked at over time. If the stock turn is slowing, this may highlight a problem with slow-moving lines that require discounting to sell through.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">Operating Expenses as a Percentage of Turnover</p>
								<p className="hdng-18">Examples of operating expenses are:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Rent</li>
									<li> Utility bills</li>
									<li> Wages, etc.</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16">This is a useful tool in assessing whether or not this area of expense is growing more rapidly than the turnover. This ratio is calculated by dividing operating expenses (overheads) by turnover and then multiplying by a hundred to make the figure into a percentage.</p>
								<img src="images/operating.jpg" alt="" />
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">Defining overheads as a percentage of turnover</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The calculation has little meaning on its own, but when reviewed over several periods it can provide useful information on the trend over that time span.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">As an organization grows this percentage should fall. If it doesn't, then the organization needs to review its operating expenses carefully to understand why this is happening and see what management can do to correct it.</p>

							<h2 className="hdng">Risk Analysis</h2>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Performing a Risk Analysis</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">This process analyzes each risk from the risk register in terms of its probability and impact on the project if it were to occur. It should be performed as soon as possible after risks have been identified so that appropriate time and resources can be allocated to the more serious risks. It uses the probability and impact matrix (PIM) to rank and prioritize risks, and this information is placed back on the risk register.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Like all the processes and procedures for managing risk, this one should be performed regularly because new risks will be identified and the characteristics of existing risk may change as the project progresses. The risk management plan (part of the overall project plan) will explain the overall approach that needs to be taken to risk management on this particular project. It will detail how much risk is acceptable and who should be involved in carrying out the qualitative analysis of the known risks.</p>
								<img src="images/matrix.jpg" alt="" />
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">The key elements of this plan used in this process are roles and responsibilities for conducting risk management, budget, schedule for risk management activities, definition of risk categories, definition of risk probability and impact, probability and impact matrix, and stakeholder's risk tolerances.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The scope of the project will have a direct bearing on the type and amount of risk that is likely to be encountered. In general terms, certain types of project are associated with certain types of risk. For example,</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Construction projects the risks would include such things like, planning permissions, weather, health and safety legislation, and labor union issues.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">IT project risks tend to be concerned with whether development software will perform as advertised and with compatibility issues.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Projects of a common or recurrent type tend to have well understood risks, whereas those breaking new ground tend to have more uncertainty.</p>
								<img src="images/bearing.jpg" alt="" />
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>There are various techniques that can be used to identify risks.</b></p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis: Tools</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Risk Probability and Impact Assessment</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Risk probability assessment investigates the likelihood that each specific risk will occur, whereas risk impact assessment investigates the potential effect on a project objective such as schedule, budget, quality, or performance.</p>
								<img src="images/data.jpg" alt="" />
								<p className="hdng-16">Both the likelihood and impact are given a score according to the definitions given in the risk plan and these can be considered together to provide a risk score. Risks with a high score will be given high priority while those with a low score will be included on a watch list for future monitoring.</p>
								<img src="images/risk.jpg" alt="" />
							</div>


							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">Probability and Impact Matrix</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Evaluation of each risk's importance and, hence, priority for attention can be done using a probability and impact matrix as shown.</p>
								<img src="images/im-matrix.jpg" alt="" />
							</div>


							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-18">This specifies combinations of probability and impact that lead to rating the risks as low, moderate, or high priority. The type of management response should be:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Threats</li>
									<ul className="site-ul">
										<li>High-risk (shown in dark gray boxes) are priority and need a hard line response.</li>
										<li> Low-risk (mid-gray boxes) need to have a contingency made for them & monitored</li>
									</ul>

									<li> Opportunities</li>
									<ul className="site-ul">
										<li>Dark gray boxes show ones to pursue first as they offer the most benefit & are more easily achieved.</li>
										<li>Mid-gray boxes indicate the ones to be monitored.</li>
									</ul>
								</ul>

								<p className="hdng-16">It is possible to rate a risk separately for cost, time, scope and quality. In addition, it can develop ways to determine one overall rating for each risk. An overall rating scheme can be developed to reflect the organization's preference for one objective over another and using those preferences to develop a weighting of the risks that are assessed by objective.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">You will also need to examine how well the risk is understood and the accuracy, quality, reliability, and integrity of the data regarding it. If data quality is unacceptable, it may be necessary to gather higher-quality data. The risk breakdown structure (RBS) is the normal way to help structure and organize all identified risks into appropriate categories, and these will assist in determining which aspects of the project have the highest degree of uncertainty.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Risks that are likely to occur in the immediate future require more urgent attention than those that may occur later on in the project. Indicators of priority should include the time required to affect a risk response. In some qualitative analysis the assessment of risk urgency can be combined with the risk ranking determined from the probability and impact matrix to give a final risk severity rating.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis: Outputs</h5>
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">The risk register can be updated with the following information.</h5>
								<img src="images/qualitative.jpg" alt="" />
								<p className="hdng-16">Relative ranking or priority list of project risks - the probability and impact matrix can be used to classify risks according to their individual significance. Risks may be listed by priority separately for schedule, cost, and performance since organizations may value one objective over another. The project manager can then use the prioritized list of risks to focus attention on those items of high significance to the most important objectives.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Risks grouped by categories - this can point to common underlying causes of risk, which may in turn suggest a holistic approach to dealing with them. Discovering concentrations of risk may also improve the effectiveness of risk responses.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">List of risks requiring response in the near-term - includes those risks that require an urgent response and those that can be handled at a later date may be put into different groups.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">List of risks for additional analysis and response - some risks might warrant more analysis, including Quantitative Risk Analysis, as well as response action.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Watch lists of low-priority risks - those that are not assessed as important in this process can be placed on a watch list for continued monitoring.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Trends in the analysis results - as this process is iterative, trends for particular types of risk may become apparent. This information can be fed back into the risk management process.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Assumptions log - the project scope statement may contain assumptions about the project, which may be updated as a result of the qualitative risk analysis done in this process.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">This is the process of analyzing the effect of those risks identified as having the potential to substantially impact the project. It may be used to assign a numerical rating to those risks individually or to evaluate their aggregate effect. You will need to use the Risk Management Plan (part of the overall Project Plan) and the Risk Register, along with cost and schedule information. You can check out the complete range of Project Management PDF eBooks free from this website.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">In some projects it may be possible to develop effective risk responses without this process. The availability of time and budget, and the need for qualitative or quantitative statements about risk and impacts, will determine which method(s) to use.</p>
								<img src="images/judment.jpg" alt="" />
								<p className="hdng-16">Structured interviews can be used to determine the probability and impact of risks from subject matter experts. This information can then be used in the following modeling techniques:</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Sensitivity Analysis - this involves analyzing the project to determine how sensitive is to particular risks by analyzing the impact and severity of each risk.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Expected Monetary Value (EMV) Analysis - determining the expected monetary value is to multiply the likelihood by the cost impact to obtain an expected value for each risk, these are then added up to obtain the expected monetary value for the project. A typical way of calculating EMV is using decision trees:</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Decision Tree Analysis - these are in the form of a flow diagram where each node, represented by a rectangle, contains a description of the risk aspect and its cost. These rectangles are linked together via arrows each arrow leading to another box representing the percentage probability.</p>
								<img src="images/outcome.jpg" alt="" />
								<p className="hdng-16">Tornado Diagrams - these are named because of their funnel shaped and portray graphically the project sensitivity to cost or other factors. Each tornado diagram will represent the impact of risks in terms of particular aspects. These aspects may be the stages of phases of all project, and are ranked vertically and represented by a horizontal bar showing plus or minus cost impacts.</p>
								<img src="images/tornado.jpg" alt="" />
								<p className="hdng-16">Monte Carlo Analysis - is normally calculated by computer by analyzing many scenarios for the project schedule and calculating the impact of particular the risk events. It is helpful in identifying risks and the effect they have on the project schedule.</p>
								<img src="images/optimistics.jpg" alt="" />
								<p className="hdng-16">Rather than ask each expert for a single value for each, the project manager would normally encourage each expert to provide an optimistic, pessimistic and realistic probability and impact value for each risk.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The risk register is further updated to include a quantitative risk report detailing quantitative approaches, outputs, and recommendations. Updates include the following:</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Probabilistic Analysis of the Project - Estimates are made of potential project schedule and cost outcomes listing the possible completion dates and costs with their associated confidence levels. This output, often expressed as a cumulative distribution, can be used with stakeholder risk tolerances to permit quantification of the cost and time contingency reserves.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Probability of Achieving Cost and Time Objectives - With the risks facing the project, the probability of achieving project objectives under the current plan can be estimated using quantitative risk analysis results.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Prioritized List of Quantified Risks - This list of risks includes those that pose the greatest threat or present the greatest opportunity to the project. These include the risks that may have the greatest effect on cost contingency and those that are most likely to influence the critical path. These risks may be identified, in some cases, through a tornado diagram generated as a result of the simulation analysis.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Trends in the analysis results. As this process is iterative, trends for particular types of risk may become apparent. This information can be fed back into the risk management process.</p>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Team Performance Evaluation</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Staff turnover can have a large impact on productivity and for some organizations this is a big issue. Of course, every business needs to hire more team members now and then.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The real problem comes when it seems like you are constantly hiring and training new staff, only to see them leave within a year.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Other team members have to take up the slack whilst the new recruit learns the ropes, or tasks get left in limbo. Either way this impacts your team’s ability to be productive. Unfortunately, this is a trend that a many organizations and managers see, but –</p>
								<p className="hdng-16"> Why does it happen ?</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">What causes this higher turnover rate ?</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">What drives the employees to want to leave after such a short period of time ?</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">When it comes to team performance evaluation, many managers remain unaware of the real reasons for dissatisfaction and high staff turnover within their team as the findings of a survey conducted in 2011 (by Kenexa) showed. The diagram shows the top five reasons why people quit their jobs, compared to the reasons 40% of managers gave.</p>
								<img src="images/balance.jpg" alt="" />
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">This reveals some valuable information on the real reasons behind staff turnover. Whilst managers were partly right they had not fully understood the causes of employee dissatisfaction, which reflects in staff turnover within their team.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">To retain and keep your team satisfied you need to look at ‘how able’ you are as their manager to address their top 5 reasons. You may not be able to keep the same people forever… but focusing your energy into three meaningful areas you will minimize the ‘churn factor’ within your team, department or division.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">You need to redirect these individuals’ energies from finding another position into contributing and fully participating in the ‘team’. To quickly gauge your team’s level of satisfaction you can use our free ‘Team Satisfaction Template’.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Regardless of the constraints you may face within your organization there are 3 ways you can actively address maintaining your ‘teams’ productivity and satisfaction.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Do you identify opportunities that will develop your people ?</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Everyone wants to be more professional, they need to believe they are headed somewhere in life, and have a purpose. Just sending people on courses is not enough, they need ‘real’ chances to develop new skills and enhance your abilities.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Finding such opportunities may be difficult in same teams, but it is imperative that you do your best to identify tasks or events that will achieve this. Take the time to know the potential each person on your team.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Then review your tasks, those of the team, its structure and opportunities within other teams that will provide the opportunity to develop them. It could be something as simple as altering who performs tasks within the team, so that new skills and expertise are acquired.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">By providing your members with these things, you will reduce their desire to leave in order to fulfill this need.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Do you challenge your team ?</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Your employees need to know that you trust them, and you show them this by asking them to perform tasks or take part in events that challenge and expand them personally.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The best and easiest way to do this is to review what actions you can delegate to others, or you may chose to reassign responsibilities within the team. Many managers have an inbuilt dread of doing this as they fear failure or poor performance will reflect badly on them.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Have faith and confidence in your team, delegation is not abandonment, it is a precisely defined action. You still retain the ultimate responsibility and use careful monitoring and mentoring to ensure the task is successfully performed.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">If you need to gain the knowledge on how to delegate the downloading a free copy of our ‘Successful Delegation’ eBook will tell you the 10 rules you need to know to do this.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Communicate and Listen to individuals</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Through the way you communicate with your team, the words you use the tone and manner of your speech all illustrate how much you respect them. The individuals are a valuable resource and asset, so treat them as such.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Your successful performance relies on theirs, you need them to be engaged and satisfied to achieve this. Winning their trust through co-operation and participation will reward you with mutual respect.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">A significant aspect of your communication must show your respect for them. They will see this in the way you encourage individuals to keep on trying, or acknowledge their commitment and efforts in accomplishing a task. A few simple words on your way to meetings, or when you get a coffee, are an excellent way to display this.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Your actions prove that they are truly valued by you and the organization. A consequence will be that they feel more content and productive and much less likely to leave because they feel ‘under-valued’.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Only by ‘actively’ listening to your team members will you create an atmosphere where communication can occur without fear of retribution. You will hear and acknowledge the advice you are given and helping you to resolve frustrating problems.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Too often managers are looking for solutions and don’t hear what those doing the job are trying to tell them. To learn more about how to develop your team download our free eBook ‘Team Development’.</p>

							<p className="hdng-16">Organizations are increasingly using project management techniques within their operations and the specialist language of project management has become more and more commonplace in managerial and executive meetings. This trend is here to stay and it means that managers need to be familiar with project management roles, terms and processes.</p>

										<p className="hdng-16">The impact of technology and its influence on organizational processes is an essential aspect of any growth strategy. It is hard to find any development or procedural change that does not have an information technology aspect and in many cases it is actually the changes in available technology that drive the need to change organizational processes.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">This has led to a merging of IT working practices into that of general management including the use of project management.</p>

										<p className="hdng-16">There are various ways in which projects can be approached and a host of 'methodologies,' 'frameworks,' and 'processes' have been developed over the past 60 years or so. Some of these have their origins in academic research whereas others have grown out of proprietary methods developed by organizations that are highly project focused, for example management consultancies.</p>

								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Project Management Methodologies</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Each of these project management methods has its own way of looking at projects and its own terminology for the documents and processes that make up project management. There has been some rationalization in recent years but there are still a dozen widely used methods. The ones you are most likely to encounter are PMBOK®, PRINCE2, Critical Chain, and Agile.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">PMBOK® is short for Project Management Body of Knowledge, which describes project management practices that are common to 'most projects, most of the time.' The PMBOK® is published by the Project Management Institute (PMI), which was formed in the USA in 1969. The PMI also offers various levels of certification and the PMBOK® is widely used and respected.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">PRINCE2 is a process-based approach for project management, providing an easily tailored and scalable methodology for the management of all types of projects. The method is the standard for public sector projects in the UK and is practiced worldwide. The acronym stands for Projects in a Controlled Environment and this is a project management program that shares more of the functional and financial authority with senior management, not just the project manager.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The Critical Chain method is not fundamentally different from the current mainstream approaches but it differs in the way that it handles risk and contingency. Developed in 1997 it is a method of planning and managing project execution designed to deal with uncertainties inherent in managing projects, while taking into consideration the limited availability of resources.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The Agile approach uses an iterative method of determining requirements for engineering and software development projects in a highly flexible and interactive manner. It is most often used in small-scale projects or in cases where the final deliverables are too complex for the customer to understand and specify before testing prototypes.</p>

								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Project Management Definition</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16"> Everything that an organization does can be categorized either as a project or process. A process is something that happens continually and has a low risk associated with it, whereas a project happens once and has a relatively high level of risk.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Before concerning ourselves with the details of project management documents and processes, it is a good idea to take a step back and think about what makes something a project and why it needs to be managed differently from the day-to-day work of the organization. In other words,</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">'Why do we need project management ?'</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">There are many different definitions of what constitutes a project:</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Project Management Institute - 'A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result.'</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">PRINCE2 - 'A Project is a temporary organization that is created for the purpose of delivering one or more business products according to an agreed Business Case.'</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Association for Project Management (APM) - 'An endeavor in which human material and financial resources are organized in a novel way to deliver a unique scope of work of given specification often within constraints of cost and time to achieve beneficial changes defined by quantitative and qualitative objectives.'</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">H. Kerzner - 'Project management is the planning, organizing, directing and controlling of company resources for a relatively short-term objective that has been established to complete specific goals and objectives. Furthermore, project management utilizes the systems approach to management by having functional personnel (the vertical hierarchy) assigned to a specific project (the horizontal hierarchy)' (2009)..</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">Many organizations also have their own definition of what constitutes a project. Whichever definition you prefer does not really matter; the important thing is to be able to identify work that constitutes a project so that it can be properly managed.</p>
								<div className="row">
									<div className="col-md-6">
										<h5 class="hdng-h5">Characteristics of a Project</h5>
										<p className="hdng-18">Projects have some or all of the following characteristics:</p>
										<ul className="site-ul">
											<li>They have a definite start and endpoint</li>
											<li>Once the endpoint is reached the project is over</li>
											<li>They are attempting to achieve something new</li>
										</ul>
										<p className="hdng-16">Projects can vary in size and small projects can be planned and managed by the same person whereas larger projects may employ thousands of people working on many sites and require a dedicated group in order to manage and coordinate the activities.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">Everything that an organization does can be categorized either as a project or process. A process is something that happens continually and has a low risk associated with it, whereas a project happens once and has a relatively high level of risk.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">To illustrate this, imagine an organization that has an annual staff appraisal process in which managers make a written assessment of their staff against criteria specified by the HR department. This is a process because even if the criteria change from year to year the procedure undertaken by everyone involved remains more or less the same.</p>
									</div>
									<div className="col-md-6">
										<img src="images/attempt.jpg" alt="" />
									</div>
								</div>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<img src="images/activity.jpg" alt="" />
								<p className="hdng-16">If the organization decided to introduce an IT system to facilitate this process then the selection, implementation, and testing of the new system would represent a project because it would be a one-off activity which carries the risk of exceeding the budget or timescale allocated to it.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">It is perfectly logical for different organizations to see the same activity in a different way. For example, the supplier of the computer system may see this activity as a process because it is something that it does every time it sells a system. Each time it does so, it gains more experience, which allows it to plan and execute future installations based on what it has learned previously.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">This distinction is important because project management is used where there is a high degree of uncertainty and risk because there is no experience of performing the activity.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">So in this scenario,</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">The organization buying the system would treat it as a project.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The vendor would treat it as part of a process.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The vendor would see it as a process that could be refined with each iteration in order to reduce costs and increase the quality. The distinction between projects and processes depends on whether the organization repeats an activity often enough for it to become routine. Once an activity is repeated often enough within an organization to become routine it is no longer considered a project - it becomes one of their many management processes.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Different types of project</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Management projects include things like: restructuring the organization, preparing for an exhibition, developing an IT system, launching a new marketing campaign, moving offices, or indeed anything where the objective is to produce an end result that is not identifiable as a physical item. To gain a greater understanding of the different functions within these type of projects look at the range of free PDF Project Management eBooks on this website. .</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">A broad range of organizations do projects of this type, including: commercial companies, government departments, charities and NGOs (Non Governmental Organizations), and other not-for-profit organizations. The differences between these types of project are:</p>
								<img src="images/intagible.jpg" alt="" />
							</div>


							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Use of Specialist Staff</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16"> Engineering projects almost always represent the day-to-day work of the organization. For example, a construction company will employ people who specialize in building office blocks, public buildings, houses, or roads.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16"> Similarly, a manufacturing company will have design engineers to take a product from conception, through the design process and prototyping before the work is handed over to production engineers who will then be responsible for mass production.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16"> This is quite different from a management project where people who don't usually run projects may find themselves doing much the work.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Environmental Issues</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">The challenges of engineering projects are often physical in nature. For example, a construction project may be held up by bad weather, the discovery of archeological remains, or other unforeseen environmental problems.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Management projects on the other hand usually take place on the organization's own premises and are not subject to these sorts of issues.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Specification of Final Deliverable</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">In the case of engineering projects the final deliverable is usually specified in detail at the beginning of the project because it will need to comply with existing standard s or legislation. If the deliverable is a mechanical or electronic part then it will need to fit with the rest of the finished product.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">This is not usually the case with management projects where the exact form of the final deliverable may not become clear until some of the work of the project has been done. It may also alter as the project develops, or in response to market research or other developments.</p>

								<h2 className="hdng">Project Management Perspectives</h2>
								<p className="hdng-16">Project management is the discipline of planning, organizing, motivating, and controlling resources to achieve specific goals. A project is a temporary endeavor designed to produce a unique product, service or result. It has a defined beginning and end (usually time-constrained, and often constrained by funding or deliverables), undertaken to meet unique goals and objectives. The primary challenge of project management is to achieve all of the project goals and objectives while honoring the constraints on scope, time, quality and budget.</p>

										</ul>
										<p> The scope of the project is defined as: 'the totality of the outputs, outcomes, and benefits and the work required to produce them'.</p>
										<p>This can change over time, and it is the project manager's responsibility to ensure the project will still deliver its defined benefits. Consequently, a project manager must maintain focus on the relative priorities of time, cost, and quality with reference to the scope of the project.</p>

										<p className="hdng-18">The Project Management Institute (PMI) defines project management in the following way:</p>
										<p className="hdng-16"> 'Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to meet project requirements.'</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">This definition begs the question 'Exactly what knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques will I need to successfully manage a project?' In order to answer this question, it is helpful to look at project management from three different perspectives.</p>
										<ul className="site-ul">
											<li>How the project fits into the organization - This refers to both the project and the individuals who will be involved in it, including how their responsibilities are defined and how they interact with each other.</li>
											<li>How the project will evolve over time - This is referred to as the project life cycle and is the chronological sequence of activities that need to happen in order to deliver the project. Whatever their differences, all projects will by definition share a similar life cycle; they will all have a beginning, middle, and an end.</li>
											<li>What skills are required to successfully manage the project - These are usually referred to as 'Project Functional Areas' because there are discrete areas within project management that can be considered in isolation even though they are interdependent.</li>

									<div className="col-md-6">
										<p className="hdng-16">This might sound unnecessarily complicated, but looking at a project from each of these three viewpoints will give you a much better understanding of the whole process than using any one of them individually.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">To use an analogy: Imagine that a ship is traveling from London to New York.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">The organizational perspective would be concerned with which members of the crew were responsible for doing what and how they communicated and interacted with each other.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">The life cycle of the voyage would be concerned with where the ship was and what it was doing at any point from the beginning to the end of the journey.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">The functional areas would be things like navigation, collision avoidance, routine maintenance, etc. Even though these activities would be taking place continuously and interdependently, it is still possible to think about them as discrete areas of knowledge.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16"> This analogy is not perfect but it does illustrate that when you are studying a complex activity it can be helpful to look at it from a variety of perspectives in order to gain a better understanding of the whole.</p>

But there will be some areas of the business concerned with physical or management infrastructure that are wholly project driven. For example:</p>

								<p className="hdng-16">The extent to which your organization has the necessary assets and processes to conduct successful projects will play a significant role in your project costs and level of risk.

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">One of the advantages of implementing a matrix structure is that it can lead to a more efficient exchange of information as people from different areas work closely together. This enhances overall productivity because it facilitates quick decision-making. For example,</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Individuals from the customer support and production departments may confer with one another to fix problems as soon as they appear. Rather than the production department remaining unaware that there is a problem until it surfaces months later in a management report or memo.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The matrix structure also encourages a democratic leadership style that incorporates the input of team members before managers make decisions. The ability to contribute valuable information before decisions are made leads to employee satisfaction and increased motivation.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">A disadvantage of the matrix structure is that it is a recipe for disagreement between the line manager and the project managers. This is because the latter will often try to minimize each department's billing to the project, whereas the departmental managers will usually try to secure as much of the project's budget as possible.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">There can also be disagreements about resource allocation and prioritization. This occurs because project managers tend to view their own project as the most important activity and forget that the line manager may have other commitments that his department is expected to meet.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Firstly, line managers have finite resources at their disposal and often have to juggle these in such a way as to 'satisfy most of the demand for most of the time.' In addition, they often have numerous deadlines, relating to both departmental work-in-progress as well as to each project that they are supplying resources to.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Secondly, projects in progress may be subject to changes, following the agreement and commitment of the line resources required. This may result from a failure to achieve the expected progress in any area of work and is likely to have a knock-on effect on the ability of the line manager to supply the resources they are committed to. As a line manager, you may also have to accommodate unexpected resource shortages due to absenteeism and staff turnover.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">All of these factors mean that conflict is unavoidable in organizations that are structured in this way and many of these issues described may be complicated further if staff are working on more than one project at a time.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Another feature of the matrix structure is that it can lead to staff members becoming concerned about the extent to which the efforts they expend on project-related work will be recognized and rewarded financially. This problem may be compounded if they feel their project-related work will not be recognized within their own department and no matter how hard they work on the project it will not affect their chances of advancement.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">This concern is primarily an issue with staff seconded to projects on a full-time basis as they may feel increasingly isolated and left behind in relation to their long-time colleagues and the departmental practices with which they are familiar. Also, individuals involved with long-term projects may have worries about what happens to them at the end of the project. Their fear could be that their department has learnt to cope without them, or developed new procedures whilst they were assigned to the project.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">As a project manager you should ensure each individual's performance is recorded and reported to their line manager so that it can be assessed in their annual appraisal. You can check out the complete range of Project Management PDF eBooks free from this website.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Projects are all about utilizing existing resources and expertise in an efficient and effective way to get things done. The downside of this, from a staff perspective, may be that projects are not seen as training-oriented environments in which to develop personal skills.</p>
								<p className="hdng-18">The questions raised by the problem of establishing a sound project management structure revolve around the creation of effective reporting lines. There are two organizational extremes that can be adopted:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>All of the personnel working on the project remain in their normal situation, reporting to their line managers. In this case, the project management staff will need to coordinate the required project work through the line managers. </li>
									<li> A project team is created and all personnel working on the project are drawn into a project team and report exclusively to the project manager. </li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16">In practice a combination of these approaches is often found to be the best solution, and is by far the most common method. However, this organizational framework risks breaking one of the tenets of good management - that of matching responsibility with authority. The project manager will be responsible for performance on the project but may lack sufficient authority where contributors report to their own line managers.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">All of these factors mean that unless your organization is completely project focused then you can expect conflict, disagreement, and compromise to be an integral part of organizing a project.</p>

									<li> In a matrix environment, an individual may 'belong to' a particular department but they will be assigned to different projects and report to a project manager while working on that project. </li>
									<li>  An advantage of the matrix structure is that it can lead to a more efficient exchange of information as people from different areas work closely together. </li>
									<li>A disadvantage of the matrix structure is that it is a recipe for disagreement between the line manager and the project managers. </li>

In this context, stakeholders are managers who have the organizational authority to allocate resources (people, money, services) and set priorities for their own organizations in support of a change.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">One of the keys to a successful project is successfully managing the relationships between everyone involved - the stakeholders.</p>

								<p className="hdng-18">There are three processes involved:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Identify the Project Stakeholders
										This involves identifying the people, groups, or organizations that could impact or be impacted by a decision, activity, or outcome of the project. It analyzes and documents their interests in and influence on the project. A stakeholder is defined as anyone with an interest in the project, irrespective of whether that interest is positive or negative. They may be individuals or organizations that are actively involved in the project, or whose interests may be affected by the execution or completion of the project.
										A project manager must be sure to identify and list all potential stakeholders for a project. In addition to those on the project team potential stakeholders include:
										<img src="images/public.jpg" alt="" />
										Stakeholders can be internal to the organization or external. In many projects the public at large will become a stakeholder to be considered during the project. The challenge for the project manager when the public is a stakeholder will be to act while considering public needs. Often there is no direct representative of the public to be consulted during project planning and execution.</li>
									<li> Analyze their potential involvement with the project This is the process that develops appropriate management strategies to effectively engage stakeholders throughout the project. Stakeholder analysis is so important that a wide variety of experts are consulted to help analyze the actual level and the desired level of engagement level of the various stakeholders. These experts are the same ones that were consulted in the previous process to identify the stakeholders and analyze their interest and/or influence on the project in order to determine the general strategy for engaging them.</li>
									<li> Manage their engagement with the project This is the process that communicates and works with stakeholders to meet their needs and expectations, address issues as they occur, and support stakeholder engagement. It details how you communicate with stakeholders and ensures appropriate engagement levels.</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16"> If you intend to manage a project then you will need a detailed knowledge of these roles and their responsibilities. However, in order to understand the basic principles of project management there are only two roles that you need to know about in any detail, the project sponsor and the project manager.</p>

										<p className="hdng-16">The sponsor is responsible for securing the financing and overall resource budget approval and owns the opportunities and risks related to the financial outcome of the project. They may be referred to as the 'business sponsor,' 'project sponsor,' or 'executive' and are usually a senior manager with a direct interest in the business case behind the project. The project manager has the authority to use cash and other resources up to the limit set in the project charter. If they believe at any stage that the project cannot be delivered within the assigned budget and timescale then they must notify the project sponsor so that remedial action can be taken.</p>

										<p className="hdng-16"> Even though this implies that the project sponsor can be a group of people, it is usually far better if there is one named individual who has been given this role. An effective sponsor will be someone with the authority and personal drive to overcome major obstacles to completing the project.</p>

										<p className="hdng-16">The sponsor does not concern himself or herself with the day-to-day running of the project (that is the responsibility of the project manager), but represents the 'buyer' of the project on behalf of the organization. It can be helpful to think about this in terms of the project manager working for the sponsor who is in turn working for the organization.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">The project sponsor may be either internal or external to the organization that will be undertaking the project work. Many different permutations are possible - for example, an internal sponsor may commission a project that will call only on resources within the organization. Alternatively, the entire project may be outsourced to a third party.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16"> The role of the project sponsor is to approve and fund the project, but not to get involved in day-to-day management or financial control. The project sponsor should appoint a project manager to take on the responsibility for delivering the project in accordance with its objectives.</p>

										<p className="hdng-16">There are two main differences between project sponsorship and project management. Firstly, project sponsorship includes the identification and definition of the project, whereas project management is concerned with delivering a project that is already defined, if only quite loosely.</p>
										<p className="hdng-18">It is important for every project to have a sponsor to:</p>
										<ul className="site-ul">
											<li>Ensure separation of decision-making responsibilities between project manager and project sponsor</li>
											<li>Ensure accountability for the realization of project benefits</li>
											<li>Ensure oversight of the project management function</li>

								<p className="hdng-16">A project manager should have experience in the project domain and should also be familiar with the processes that make up project management.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">You should now have an understanding of some of the problems involved when setting up a project that needs to run 'across' organizations, which tend to have vertical management structures. You should also be aware of some of the issues that are raised when assigning people to projects, particularly if they have continuing duties in their own department, and you can bring attention to potential issues before they arise.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Finally, with the knowledge of the specific roles and responsibilities of the project sponsor and the project manager you can ensure that others within your organization are aware of these requirements when developing a project.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The project manager should be appointed, by the project owner, to assume day-to-day management of the project. The project manager should be responsible for planning at the project and sub-project level, exercising control, ensuring product delivery and for management and motivation of staff working on the project.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Successful project management involves dealing effectively with managers and supporting personnel across departmental and functional lines, often with little or no formal authority.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The project manager should work with the project owner to appoint the sub-project managers and to define their responsibilities. Thereafter, the sub-project managers will report directly to the project manager, via regular progress reports. These progress reports represent an up-to-date summary of the status of the project and should be compiled on a regular basis, usually weekly of every two weeks.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">It is the project manager's responsibility to analyze and collate the progress reports and to summarize this information in regular highlight reports which should be presented to the project owner. Highlight reports should be produced at regular intervals, for example monthly, and may also be produced in response to exceptional circumstances.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The project manager will need to maintain clear communications with other management bodies, appropriate to the size of the project. They should submit the project plans and sub-project plans to the project owner for approval and then advise the owner if there are any significant deviations from them. If tolerances are being exceeded then remedial plans may also need to be submitted for the approval of the project owner.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">An important function of the project manager is to establish an appropriate environment within which the project is to operate. A number of issues need to be addressed early on to ensure that the project can proceed efficiently and effectively from the outset.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">In addition to preparing the project plan, the project manager should specify or create a configuration management method for the project. Configuration management covers the tracking, documentation and issue of all project documents and products, throughout the project life cycle.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The project manager should agree the technical and quality strategy for the project, with the section that is responsible for organizational policy. It is important that the project manager also maintains clear communication with any related projects to ensure that work is neither overlooked nor duplicated.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Decisions which effect the strategic direction of a project will almost certainly need to be referred to a senior management body or individual, but it is the project manager who will have to make the recommendations and then put into effect the decisions made.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The project manager should be aware that disagreements have the potential to arise at all levels. The intensity of any particular conflict may be affected by a variety of factors including approaching deadlines, a squeeze on resources or the individual characteristics of those involved.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The issue which underlies a particular conflict may not be immediately apparent. Personality clashes are a classic underlying problem that very few people feel able to raise and discuss. It is common for personality conflicts to manifest themselves as a dispute over some project issue - for example a technical stand-off. This is where experience is invaluable, enabling the project manager to identify the real issues and then to address them effectively.</p>

								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Starting the project</li>
									<li>Organizing and preparing</li>
									<li>Carrying out the work</li>
									<li>Closing the project</li>
								</ul>

								<p className="hdng-18">This is known as a four-phase life cycle and the phases are usually referred to as:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Project Initiation</li>
									<li>Project Planning</li>
									<li>Project Execution</li>
									<li>Project Closure</li>
								</ul>

								<div className="row">
									<div className="col-md-6">
										<p className="hdng-16">Each of these phases is made up of discrete activities, each of which has an associated definition and guidelines. The number of activities depends on the scope of the project.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">A simple project will involve only a few activities while a more complex project may involve hundreds or thousands of individual activities. This model can be applied to a variety of project scenarios although the cost and duration of each phase will vary according to the particular project. Projects are temporary structures set up with the specific aim of delivering an identifiable end-product. All projects will therefore have an identifiable life cycle, the characteristics of which will vary according to the size and complexity of the project.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">For example, in the case of a project whose aim is to evaluate, recommend and implement a computerized accounts system. The costs of the project are restricted to the selection of the most suitable system available and the training and implementation necessary for its introduction. The actual purchase of the system is not within the terms of reference of the project, as this capital cost will be taken from a separate budget.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">A typical life cycle will run from the formal initiation of a project through to a post implementation review of the delivered end-product. This post implementation review is not shown as it is usually held some months after the project has been formally closed. There is often little agreement between industries, or even between organizations within the same industry, about the life cycle phases of a project. This is understandable because of the complicated nature and diversity of projects.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">A five phase project life cycle model can be applied to a variety of project scenarios although the cost and duration of each phase will vary according to the particular project. The conceptual phase includes the preliminary evaluation of an idea. It is common for this phase to include a first cut feasibility study for the proposed project. This analysis should also include a preliminary risk assessment.</p>
									</div>
									<div className="col-md-6">
										<img src="images/phase.jpg" alt="" />
									</div>
								</div>
							</div>


							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">The definition phase is primarily a refinement of those areas considered in the conceptual phase. The resources required by the project should be defined along with time, cost and performance estimates. Project estimation is a difficult task - especially in this early phase. However it is essential that costs are quantified, as this information is needed to establish whether or not the project should proceed.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Once a project has received the funding and backing of senior management it can proceed to the production phase. This incorporates the production, or acquisition, of the end-product specified. This begins with the updating of detailed plans, started in the preceding phases and encompasses the identification and management of the resources required. This phase also includes the development of manuals, plans and other documentation that will support the end product in its live environment.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The operation phase involves the integration of the end-product or service into the organizational environment. If the end-product was a marketable product then this phase would typically include the product life cycle phases of marketing and refinement. The divestment phase involves the reallocation of resources that are no longer required by the current project. The end-product of any project will have a finite lifespan and therefore its ability to generate revenue will be limited. The organization will usually need to run future projects to guarantee its revenue stream.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">It is therefore important to retain the services of staff and other resources that can be used in forthcoming projects. This phase also incorporates the post implementation evaluation of the delivered end-product, and this should serve as input to the conceptual phase of future projects.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The use of resources over time will vary according to each particular project. Whilst it may be possible to characterize life cycle profiles within different industry sectors, this can give a false impression as individual projects can vary radically from the generic profile.</p>

								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Functional Areas of Project Management</h5>
								<div className="row">
									<div className="col-md-6">
										<p className="hdng-16">Project management can be organized into functional areas, for example: managing the scope, managing the budget, managing the schedule, managing risk, etc. The reason for doing this is that it allows complex high-level tasks to be broken down into smaller tasks, a common practice when learning something new. For example, when learning to drive you concentrate on specific tasks, such as gear changing, hill starts etc., before you drive on an interstate road or motorway.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">So far in this eBook, we have dealt with the organizational aspects of the project and the project life cycle, both of these ways of looking at projects can help you to appreciate the principles of project management. However, you can also look at project management from the perspective of the individual processes involved. These processes can be organized into functional areas, for example: managing the scope, managing the costs, managing the schedule, managing risk, etc.</p>

								<p className="hdng-16">The reason for doing this is that it allows complex high-level tasks to be broken down into smaller tasks, a common practice when learning something new. For example, when learning to drive you concentrate on specific tasks, such as gear changing, hill starts etc., before you drive on an interstate road or motorway. </p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Extending this approach to project management makes tasks easier to manage, resource, and control. Thinking about project management activities like scoping, scheduling, quality, and risk in isolation before trying to integrate them into a real project minimizes the potential for misinterpretation, and makes each area easier to understand. However, whilst these functional areas can be presented as being more or less self-contained, in practice they overlap and interact in a unique fashion that reflects the nature of a project.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Consequently, the functional areas are not meant to be prescriptive activities that are executed one after the other. You do not perform scoping, then scheduling, then costing, then quality control, etc. in sequence. You need to be continually reviewing each area as the project progresses and new information becomes available.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">For example, looking at the scope management activity as something discrete makes sense because even if it is being done at the same time as one or more of the other processes it is always done in the same way. There is no need to do different types of scope management at different stages of the project because scope management is scope management no matter when you do it and no matter what else is happening at the same time.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>Managing the Project Team</b> This includes all of the processes used to put together, develop, and manage the project team. It also includes identifying what information needs to be communicated and to whom, in order to ensure that the right people get the right information at the right time. </p>
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>Managing the Project Scope</b> This is the process by which the project manager defines the boundaries of the project and ensures that any changes to the original scope are carefully managed. It defines exactly what is included in the project and what is excluded.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>Managing the Project Schedule</b> This involves making sure that things happen on time and keeping the project on schedule. It includes techniques to estimate how long things will take, to plan accordingly, and then to keep everything on track.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>Managing the Project Budget</b>This involves keeping the project on budget and includes techniques for estimating costs planning and budgeting as well as monitoring and controlling the costs. Some of the materials and services required to complete the project may need to be obtained from outside suppliers. If this is the case then the project manager will also need an understanding of contract and supplier management.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16"> <b>Managing Project Quality</b> This ensures that the project meets its requirements and that the deliverables do what is expected of them.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<div className="row">
									<div className="col-md-6">
										<p className="hdng-16"><b>Managing Project Risk</b> This involves the identification and evaluation of risk as well as planning responses to ensure that corrective action is taken if the risks materialize.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">It would be much easier (although far less flexible) if it were possible to specify a simple linear path involving preparing, planning, doing and reviewing. Unfortunately, this approach is only possible in very simple projects and even then it falls apart as soon as something unexpected happens. Looking at project management in terms of it's functional area approach is far more flexible, but it does require that you are able to select the right tool at the right stage in the project and this requires judgment.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">This judgment requires knowledge and experience, which is one reason why experienced project managers are always in high demand. It also underlines the importance of recording as much as possible about how projects are performing. This information can be used to analyze how and why projects have succeeded or failed in the past.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">By definition a project is going to change something in the way that the organization works and this is something that needs to be explained to all of the project stakeholders in order to get them on board and then to keep them there. This is easier said than done and what makes the discipline of project management so complex is that in order to satisfy all stakeholder requirements you need to manage interactions across organizational and process boundaries.</p>

										<p className="hdng-16">A great deal of this management takes place at the boundary of the project and involves resources other than those that are controlled directly by the project manager. Consequently, a key part of project management is to gain commitment from others outside of the project to provide these resources as and when necessary. This is something that relies on highly developed interpersonal skills including persuasion and negotiation. Complex projects need more management tools and techniques than small projects and a project manager needs to know which tools to use and when.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">The aim of every project manager should be to use the smallest number of project management tools and techniques possible to deliver the project objectives. Remember, project management must never become the focus of effort. It is always a means to an end, not an end in itself.</p>

							<h2 className="hdng">Process Optimasation</h2>
							<h2 className="hdng">Lean Six Sigma Methodology</h2>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Team Performance Evaluation</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">The Lean Six Sigma methodology is a popular approach for improving the performance of many organizations. Combining many of the features of both lean manufacturing and Six Sigma, Lean Six Sigma was brought to the forefront in the early 2000’s. Six Sigma is focused on continually improving processes in order to maximize efficiency and minimize the number of defects that occur in any process. Lean manufacturing is a method of eliminating waste throughout the manufacturing process using a number of strategies and technique. The two have been combined to create a method that can help many different kinds of organizations optimize their performance.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Within Lean Six Sigma there are eight kinds of wastes that are identified. Below are basic definitions of what each of the eight wastes refers to, and how they are important in the big picture of the organization.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Defects</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">The impact that process defects can have on an organization should be obvious. When manufacturing a product, for example, each product that has a defect becomes a waste of resources. If an organization is able to limit those defects as much as possible, they will be left with a process that is more effective – and hopefully more profitable. Defects are a major point within Six Sigma, and the constant effort to improve processes is based around removing defects.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Overproduction</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">When an organization produces more than what they need, or they produce it too early, overproduction can become an issue. If too much of a given product is produced, the excess could be wasted and therefore should never have been produced in the first place. If the product is produced ahead of time, it will have used up resources that could have been allocated in a different manner for the time being. Also, when dealing with a physical good, products that are produced early will have to be stored, again taking up extra resources.</p>
							</div>


							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Waiting</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Timing is very important in business. When working on a project, you want one step of the work to lead naturally into the next with no time wasted by people or machines. If you are spending money to have people available or machines ready that aren’t going to be used yet, there will again be a waste of resources. The more waiting that can be eliminated from a process, the more efficient it will be.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Non-utilized Talent</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Making the most of the people that you have available is one of the biggest skills involved with being a good leader. Organizations that follow the Lean Six Sigma methodology will be focused on making the most of what they have in-house so that those people are being used to the best of their abilities. For example, if an employee who is already on the payroll has the skills and experience to complete a certain task, the organization may be able to save money by not having to hire a contractor to do the same work.</p>
							</div>


							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Transportation</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Every inch that a product moves is going to cost the organization money in one way or another. Moving product can be one of the most-expensive activities for many businesses, so making sure that transportation is streamlined and optimized should stay near the top of the priority list. As the needs of customers change, the transportation process should constantly be reviewed and updated so that it keeps up with the time. Using an outdated transportation process is an easy way to spend more money than is necessary to get products or materials where they need to go.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5"> Inventory</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Holding products and materials in inventory when they aren’t needed also costs resources. The space that is taken up by that inventory could potentially be better used for another purpose, or it could be eliminated altogether so the cost of the space could be taken off the books. This is a key concept that comes out of the idea of Lean Manufacturing. Not having excess products on hand that aren’t needed will allow the organization to function more efficiently.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5"> Motion</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Just like products and materials shouldn’t be transported any more than necessary, people should also be optimized in terms of their movements. If a worker has to walk all the way from one end of the factory to the other to complete a certain task, only to return immediately back to where they started, all of that time is lost. Manufacturing processes should be designed in such a way that motion is limited so people can get more work done within a given amount of time.</p>
							</div>



							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5"> Extra-Processing</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">All organizations want to do a good job and put out good products, but going too far can be just as damaging as not going far enough in terms of quality. The organization should be striving to deliver exactly what the customer has asked for, and paid for. When a company starts to over deliver the products that they have promised, a couple of problems can develop. First, the customer will have no motivation to pay for a higher quality product when they are already receiving one for a lower cost. Also, resources will be used toward creating this better product when they weren’t needed. This is another example of waste, and one that can be hard to spot because it might not seem like a problem at first.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Lean Six Sigma combines ideas and tools from two of the most popular methods in business – Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma. The eight wastes above are a great way to understand what Lean Six Sigma is aimed at improving, but they are just the start of what is a vast subject. Educating yourself on Lean Six Sigma will give you an additional tool to help better make decisions and lead your own organization. Whether your company is formally employing the Lean Six Sigma method or you are just trying to expand your business operations knowledge, the concepts that are presented in this method are certainly worth understanding.</p>
							</div>


							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Key Points</h5>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Lean Six Sigma is a methodology that relies on a collaborative team effort to improve performance by systematically removing waste.</li>
									<li> The eight kinds of waste are: defects, overproduction, waiting, non-utilized talent, transportation, inventory, motion, and extra-processing.</li>
									<li>Lean Six Sigma emphasizes the use of methodologies and tools to identify and remove waste and increase process velocity, then follows with the use of Six Sigma methodologies and tools to identify and reduce or remove process variation.</li>

								<h2 className="hdng">Six Sigma DMAIC</h2>
								<p className="hdng-16">Six Sigma DMAIC seeks to improve the quality output of a process by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes. As you certainly already know, constant improvement should be a goal for any organization. All businesses have a set of processes that dictate a large degree of their day-to-day activities, and improving on those processes over time is one of the best ways to lead an organization to the top. The business that is simply satisfied with how they are doing currently is one that will struggle to keep up with the competition. There is always room for improvement in the eyes of a successful business leader.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Improvement is at the heart of what Six Sigma is all about. Process improvement is the goal when Six Sigma is used, and this set of tools has grown over the three decades or so to become one of the most-important concepts in business. Countless organizations have used Six Sigma to improve on what they do, and it is a key idea for any professional to understand. Statistical analysis is rooted deep within the background of Six Sigma. At is heart, this is a statistic method that strives to cut out variables from any process in order to improve performance and consistency.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Striving for Predictability One of the keys to Six Sigma is creating processes that are as stable and predictable as possible. While this is easy to think of in terms of manufacturing, it can apply successfully to just about any business model. When a process in undertaken with the goal of creating a certain output, the organization should strive to successfully reach that output as frequently as possible. If there are too many errors, or defects, within a process, the company will be wasting resources and opportunities.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Within Six Sigma, this concept is often represented as ‘defective parts per million opportunities’, or DPMO. Using DPMO is a way to track how many mistakes are being made within a given process. A mistake or ‘defect’ can be defined in any way that is relevant to the organization and the process at hand. For physical manufacturing, it may be that a defect is a final product which rolls off the assembly line and doesn’t pass a quality inspection. Of course, that is just one example – a defect for the purposes of Six Sigma can be defined in any number of ways.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">To achieve Six Sigma, a process must have no more than 3.4 DPMO. In other words, no more than 3.4 defective parts must be discovered per million opportunities. At first, this can seem like quite the intimidating number to achieve. However, that is the point of the Six Sigma approach to production. Constantly refining the process until it is highly effective and efficient can create a path toward long-term success.</p>
							</div>


							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">The Ability to Be Measured</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">In order to use statistical analysis in a productive manner, the business must be using processes that can be measured in the first place. It is impossible to determine how many defects per million are occurring if the process has not be structured in a way that lends itself to measurement. Therefore, the Six Sigma approach has to be adopted throughout an organization so that the processes being used lend themselves nicely to the statistical analysis that will be done later on. Ongoing analysis of the measurements provided by each process can be done to achieve the constant improvement that is at the heart of what Six Sigma hopes to achieve in any organization.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Six Sigma DMAIC</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">When it comes to running projects within a Six Sigma framework, DMAIC is one of the most-popular methods to put into use. It stands for Define – Measure – Analyze – Improve – Control, and those five steps highlight the way in which a project should be undertaken. DMAIC is intended for use on projects that are trying to improve a current process within an organization.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Define. This is the beginning of a project where the goals are being outlined and properly defined. What is going to be required by the end customer? What methods are going to be used to help reach the ultimate goal? Clear definition of a project is crucial to its success.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Measure. At this stage, the goal is to measure what the current process is doing so problems can be discover that can be solved later on. It is impossible to improve on something without knowing what its strengths and weaknesses are, so measurement is necessary before moving on.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Analyze. Once there have been weaknesses identified within the process, the analyze step is meant to provide an opportunity to attribute cause to the defects so that they can be fixed. The data that has been collected should be carefully analyzed to be sure that the right cause and effect relationships are determined. Without taking the time to analyze what has been found, the possibility exists that you could go on to try solving a problem that didn’t exist in the first place.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Improve. Now is the time when all of the measurement and analysis can be put to use in actually fixing a problem or defect. Once solutions to the problem at hand are discovered, pilot tests are often done to test the solutions on a small scale before rolling them out fully.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Control. The new and improved process will still need to be monitored and tracked going forward to make sure it is as productive and effective as you hope. Of course, there will likely be more defects and problems to fix down the line, which is why the concept of Six Sigma is really a never-ending approach to long-term improvement and optimization.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The concept of Six Sigma is vast and far-reaching, and the information above only touches the tip of the iceberg. Six Sigma applies to a wide range of organizations and is used by many of the biggest companies in the world. For any business leader, manager, or owner, understanding the tools and techniques that make up Six Sigma is certainly something worth adding to your knowledge base.</p>

								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Key Points</h5>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>The Six Sigma DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) methodology is a roadmap for problem solving and product/process improvement.</li>
									<li> DMAIC is not exclusive to Six Sigma and can be used as the framework for other improvement applications.</li>
									<li> Most companies begin implementing Six Sigma using the DMAIC methodology, and later add the DFSS methodology when the organizational culture and experience level permits.</li>

							<h2 className="hdng">Quality Management Techniques</h2>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Quality Management</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">There are several techniques that can be used in the quality planning process but it is very unlikely that any individual project manager would be expected to be skilled in using all of them.</p>
								<div className="row">
									<div className="col-md-6">
										<p className="hdng-16">A better approach would be to have an appreciation of what each one involves and then to select those that best suit the project and delegate the work to project team members who have expertise in that technique.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">A cost-benefit analysis is by far the most important decision making tool and involves nothing more than common sense and judgment based on experience. All quality management activities have a related cost and that cost must be justified in terms of benefit to the project sponsor and the organization as a whole.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">No activities should be performed that would equal or cost more than the expected benefits. It should show that the level of quality is viable from a cost perspective and justify its inclusion in the quality plan.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">The cost of quality includes all costs incurred over the life of the product and looks at the costs of conformance to quality standards and the costs of nonconformance.</p>
									</div>
									<div className="col-md-6">
										<img src="images/analysis.jpg" alt="" />
									</div>
								</div>
							</div>


							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Cost of Quality</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">For example, the proposed quality standard for the production of a metal pressing might mandate a tolerance of 1mm. In other words the finished part can be up to 1mm bigger or smaller than the specification.</p>
								<div className="row">
									<div className="col-md-6">
										<p className="hdng-16">The costs of conformance include both the prevention and appraisal costs incurred in conforming to this standard (Training, equipment, additional time, testing and inspections).</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">The costs of nonconformance include internal and external costs that would be incurred if this quality standard were not achieved. These would include the costs of reworking or scrapping the failed parts (internal cost) and the costs associated with sending out parts that were unacceptable to the customer.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">Project decisions can impact operational costs of quality as a result of product returns, warranty claims, and recall campaigns. Therefore, due to the temporary nature of a project, the sponsoring organization may choose to invest in product quality improvement, especially defect prevention and appraisal, to reduce the external cost of quality.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">Most of the techniques described here are based on statistical analysis and are most appropriate where the project deliverables are products that can be measured in some way. For example, If parts are being produced on a production line then it will be straightforward to measure dimensions, tolerances, failure rates, etc. However, many project deliverables are not like this and it is not possible to collect this type of data. For example, anything that provides a user 'experience' can be difficult to measure in this way.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">The best approach is to be aware of what tools and techniques exist and to select those that are appropriate for the project you are working on. It may even be possible to adapt some of them in order to provide useful data about quality even if you are not making a product that can easily be measured.</p>
									</div>
									<div className="col-md-6">
										<img src="images/conformance.jpg" alt="" />
									</div>
								</div>
							</div>


							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Cause and Effect Diagrams</h5>
								<p className="hdng-18">Also called Ishikawa diagrams or fishbone diagrams, they illustrate how various factors might be linked to potential problems or effects. Factors are usually grouped into major categories as shown:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>People - Anyone involved with the process</li>
									<li>Methods - How the process is performed including: policies, procedures, rules, regulations and laws</li>
									<li>Machines - Any equipment, computers, tools, etc. required to accomplish the job.</li>
									<li> Materials - Raw materials, parts, pens, paper, etc. used to produce the final product</li>
									<li> Measurements - Data generated from the process that is used to evaluate it's quality</li>
									<li>Environment - The conditions, such as location, time, temperature, and culture in which the process operates</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16">This is not a statistical technique and is therefore applicable to almost all types of project. It does have its critics precisely because is not quantitative and requires a lot of subjective analysis and judgment.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">It's strengths are that it can help you to make sense of a situation where there are a lot of variables that are interacting with each other, none of which are quantifiable. It is also a powerful visual tool when you are trying to explain your analysis to others.</p>
							</div>


							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5"> Flowcharts</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16"> This is a graphical representation of a process showing the relationships among process steps. There are many styles, but all process flowcharts show: activities, decision points, and the order of processing.
									Flowcharting can help the project team anticipate quality problems that might occur and this awareness can result in the development of test procedures or approaches for dealing with them.</p>
								<img src="images/begin .jpg" alt="" />

								<p className="hdng-16">A flowchart is common type of chart that represents an algorithm or process, showing the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting them with arrows.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">There are many different types of flowcharts, and each type has its own repertoire of boxes and notational conventions.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The two most common types of boxes in a flowchart are: a processing step (usually called an activity) that is denoted as a rectangular box, and a decision, which is usually denoted as a diamond.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Flowcharts are used in designing and documenting complex processes. Like other types of diagram, they help visualize what is going on and thereby help the viewer to understand a process, and perhaps also find flaws, bottlenecks, and other less-obvious features within it.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Checksheets</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16"> These are also known as tally sheets and may be used as a checklist when gathering data. They are used to organize facts in a manner that will facilitate the effective collection of useful data about a potential quality problem and are especially useful for gathering attributes data while performing inspections to identify defects.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Pareto Diagram</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16"> This is a special type of histogram where the values being plotted are arranged in descending order. The graph is accompanied by a line graph that shows the cumulative totals of each category.</p>
								<img src="images/arrival .jpg" alt="" />
								<p className="hdng-16">Left vertical axis shows the frequency of occurrence, cost or other important unit of measure. Right vertical axis is the cumulative percentage of the total.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">In quality control, the Pareto chart often represents the most common sources of defects, the highest occurring type of defect, or the most frequent reasons for customer complaints, etc. The Pareto chart was developed to illustrate the 80-20 Rule, which states that 80 percent of the problems stem from 20 percent of the various causes.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Histogram</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">This is a vertical bar chart showing how often a particular variable state occurred, with the height of each column representing the relative frequency. Histograms are useful when presenting project data to stakeholders as they can give a clear indication of which problems are the most important to tackle.</p>
							</div>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5"> Control Charts</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">These answer the question: 'Is this process variance within acceptable limits?' The pattern of data points on a control chart may reveal random fluctuating values, sudden process jumps, or a gradual trend in increased variation. By monitoring the output of a process over time, a control chart can help assess whether the application of process changes resulted in the desired improvements.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">When a process is within acceptable limits it is in control and does not need to be adjusted. Conversely, when a process is outside acceptable limits, the process should be adjusted. Seven consecutive points above or below the central line indicate a process that is out of control. The upper control limit and lower control limit are usually set at (plus or minus) three Sigma, where one Sigma is one standard deviation. </p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Although used most frequently to track repetitive activities required for producing manufactured lots, control charts may also be used to monitor cost and schedule variances, volume, and frequency of scope changes, or other management results to help determine if the project management processes are in control.	</p>
							</div>


							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Scatter Diagram</h5>
								<p className="hdng-18">These use Cartesian coordinates to display values for two variables for a set of data. The data is displayed as a collection of points, each having the value of one variable determining the position on the horizontal axis and the value of the other variable determining the position on the vertical axis. A scatter diagram can suggest various kinds of correlations between variables with a certain confidence level. Correlations may be:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Positive (rising) - If the pattern of dots slopes from lower left to upper right, it suggests a positive correlation.</li>
									<li> Negative (falling) - If the pattern of dots slopes from upper left to lower right, it suggests a negative correlation.</li>
									<li> Null (uncorrelated).</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16"> A line of best fit can be drawn in order to study the correlation between the variables. One of the most powerful aspects of a scatter diagram is its ability to show nonlinear relationships between variables.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Benchmarking</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Benchmarking is simply a quality standard reference that is used for the current project. This may be a benchmark used within the performing organization, or one that is used across a specific industry. It involves comparing actual or planned project practices to those of comparable projects to identify best practices, generate ideas for improvement, and provide a basis for measuring performance. The value of using this technique is to compare the current project's quality standards with those of other similar projects.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Quality Meetings</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Meetings involve people who are responsible for quality management including the project manager, the project sponsor, selected project team members, selected stakeholders, anyone with responsibility for any of the quality management processes, and others as needed. Collective decision-making is very important area of project management that can make or break this part of the project. Almost all of the processes that for part of project time management will involve meetings between the project manager, the team and other stakeholders in order to make decisions about the activity definitions and associated estimates. How well these meetings are conducted will have a major impact on how smoothly the project runs.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">If you feel as though your project meetings could be improved then you can download the 'Meeting Skills' eBooks from this website. These free eBooks cover all aspects of meetings including how to set an agenda that will ensure that the meeting achieves it's aims and how to chair a meeting so that it is as productive as possible.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Key Points</h5>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>A project manager should have an appreciation of what quality techniques are available so that they are able to select those that best suit the project</li>
									<li> Implementation of the technique can then be delegated to project team members who have the relevant expertise in that technique.</li>
									<li> These techniques include: cause and effect diagrams, flowcharts, check sheets, Pareto diagrams, and scatter diagrams.</li>
