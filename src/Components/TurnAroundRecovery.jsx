								<p className="hdng-16">This is even more true with the more complex tools that come into play with larger transformation or scaling up initiatives. Consider building a circle of experts that you can consult or bring into the work with your client where your own expertise falls short.</p>

							<h2 className="hdng">Establishing the baseline</h2>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-18">There are a three opportunities to conduct the survey with your clients:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>As part of your sales process</li>
									<li>During your initial consultation</li>
									<li>As part of closing out the engagement with the client</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16">You should always attempt to use the survey to establish a baseline as part of your sales process or as part of your initial consultation with your client</p>
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>TIP:</b> Clients will have a wide range of assessments of the relatively subjective measures for each of the questions. Some will rate themselves overly harsh, based on the scope for possible improvements. Others will give themselves higher scores than they probably deserve. See below for strategies to deal with this.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">The benefits of using the survey as part of a sales process</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">When you are working with a prospective client, you can complete the survey with them as part of your sales process.</p>
								<p className="hdng-18">The benefits of using the survey as part of the process include:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Demonstrating that you are looking at the business professionally and from a holistic viewpoint</li>
									<li>Forming first impressions about the client’s personal style, capacity and nature of their business — this also helps you to decide if this is a client that you want to help / are able to help</li>
									<li>Obtaining some preliminary financial performance data</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16">If your prospect completes the survey online, ensure that you get back to them within 48 hours of the completion to schedule a follow-up discussion where you can talk about their results and how you can assist them to improve their business.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>TIP:</b> If you choose to complete the survey with the client in a discussion / interview format, you get all of the benefits above, plus the benefits of using the survey in the first consultation session described below. An hour spent with the prospect in this manner is much more likely to result in a successful sale. You can position this as the first hour of consultation is FREE.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">Using the survey as part of your initial consultation</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">If you have just met the client, establishing trust and rapport is one of the critical goals of your first consultation session. See the Business Builder for Consultants manual for some more suggestions on the all-important first session.</p>
								<p className="hdng-18">Talking through the survey with the client has the following additional benefits over and above those listed above:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Engaging the client in a question and response dialog format sets the tone and expectations for how the coaching relationship will work</li>
									<li>You start building trust with the client as the survey encourages them to disclose information about their business that they would not normally disclose to strangers</li>
									<li>You are able to explore why the client rates certain answers high and certain answers low, which gives you some ideas of where they see the opportunities, challenges and strong points of themselves, their teams and their business</li>
									<li>You can gently calibrate some of the answers towards more realistic assessments, by asking probing follow-up questions if the client is scoring consistently high or consistently low.</li>
									<li>You can identify and even possibly decide on the one or two key priorities to focus on in the coming months. The process will make the client realise or believe that there are a large number of areas that need their immediate attention. Your job as consultant is to assist them with the one or two that will make the most impact, and guide them through the journey in a logical manner.</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>TIP:</b> In this session consider using only your coaching skills, and leave your analytical mind behind the screen. Open, curious questions will elicit a lot of information that will be useful in your future work.</p>

							<h2 className="hdng">Evaluating the survey results</h2>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">The first meeting</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">In order to meaningfully discuss the results of the survey with your client, you need to know something about their business and the challenges that they face. The first meeting with your client can also be called the GTKY meeting (Getting To Know You).</p>
								<p className="hdng-18">The main goals of the GTKY meeting are:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Starting to build trust and rapport with your client — you will need this later on when you need to help them discover and deal with unpleasant truths about their business models, staff members, own behaviours and assumptions, etc.</li>
									<li>Getting an understanding of your client’s preferred styles (detailed vs high level, cautious vs adventurous, data driven), how do they balance emotions and logic, what are their values around people, customers, etc.</li>
									<li>Get to know how your client’s business functions at a high level — how do they make money, how many people do they have, what is their geographic scope, what are their target markets, products and services, current challenges</li>
									<li>Agreeing one or two priority focus areas — ideally guide the conversation to areas where it would be possible to show some early gains and benefits. You can use the Business Builder survey to guide this conversation. These priorities can always be revisited as you build a deeper understanding of the true challenges in the business</li>
									<li>Getting commitment from the client to work with you for at least 3 to 6 months, including showing up for meetings and doing the homework between sessions</li>
								</ul>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-18">Some of the types of questions that will be useful in this session could be:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li><b>Building rapport:</b> When did you start the business? What were your dreams and aspirations? Can you remember how it felt when you got payment on your first invoice? What were the things that made you leave your job (if they left the corporate environment to start their business)</li>
									<li><b>Business model and market:</b> What are your most successful product or service offerings? Who is your biggest customer? Which industry / market do you like working in most?</li>
									<li><b>Current challenges:</b> What worries you most about your team? Suppliers? Financial performance? Market conditions? Geopolitical, social, environmental or other macro trends?</li>
									<li><b>Strategic direction:</b> What do you plan to do with the business in 5 to 10 years? How many people would you like to employ? How much profit do you want to make in 5 to 10 years?</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16">The most important preparation you can do for this meeting is to cultivate an attitude of curiosity and attentive listening. This is not yet the time to give advice and instructions (it is probably never a good time to give instructions).</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">How important is an accurate score for each question</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">As mentioned in the Business Builder Consultants manual clients’ subjective assessment of their own business will vary significantly from one business to the next. Over time you will form your own impressions of the true score for each area and what the types of questions are that would give you a better view of the actual situation.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">You will also be able to judge fairly rapidly if the client is overly harsh on themselves, or have a realistic view of their business, or are being overly generous in their assessment of themselves. This might be based on a lack of knowledge of the required skills and processes, a lack of deep reflection on the business, or simply protecting the ego if this is a client at the beginning of their journey.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">In the Business Builder training we advise that you have to decide for yourself if you wish to challenge the client’s assessment and potentially making it harder to build trust and rapport, or if you will use their assessment to deepen the conversation about core focus areas.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Whichever approach you choose will result in a highest scoring area, a lowest scoring area and a spread in between. It is highly likely that you will have fairly similar scores across the various components, as companies typically have to get most of these components to a certain level of maturity and competence to grow to whichever level they are.</p>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<div className="row">
									<div className="col-md-4">
										<img src="images/turnaround-recovery.jpg" alt="" />
									</div>
									<div className="col-md-8">
										<p className="hdng-16">The first set of survey results point to four “buckets” of actions and strategies to generate more cash in the business. Two of these buckets are more short-term in nature, and two are more structural and require medium / longer term re-alignment or restructuring of the business.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">It should be noted that a higher score in these results indicate greater opportunities for improvement and the colours of the graphs should be interpreted from the point of view of how far away the business is from having executed all possible turnaround strategies. In other words, RED means that there are many opportunities to turn the business around, and green means that all possible levers have been pulled.</p>
										<p className="hdng-18">It is helpful to know a bit more about your client’s business in discussing the survey results, and we propose that you do a GTKY session as described above as part of the interpretation of the results.</p>
									</div>
								</div>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">Cost efficiencies</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Cost efficiencies focus on immediate actions to improve cash flow or reduce costs. As described in the survey results these are firefighting or belt-tightening exercises. Work through these with your client to identify if there is a need for a structured cost-reduction project.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The key danger in cost reduction programs is to cut too deeply, leaving the organisation unable to survive. Ensure that you discuss the direct short-term and long-term impacts of cost reduction with your client.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>TIP:</b> Beware of the sunk cost fallacy. A sunk cost is any cost that’s already been invested and can’t be retrieved.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The sunk cost fallacy (sometimes called the lost cost fallacy or trap) is a cognitive bias that causes people to stick with a plan, course, or approach that isn’t working because of how much has already been invested in it. Investment here can mean money, time, effort, or all three.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Some examples of cost reduction activities that can have unintended consequences are discussed below</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">Reducing Research & Development (R&D) expenditure</h5>
								<p className="hdng-18">Most companies do not have a formal R&D department where they spend large amounts of money, and generally R&D would be captured as innovation or improvement projects. Some examples of things to consider before reducing R&D spend are:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>If your client is in a sector or industry where R&D is a critical success factor or competitive advantage (e.g. technology, pharmaceuticals) cost reductions could lead to the business eventually failing due to obsolescence.</li>
									<li>If the R&D expenditure is driving operational efficiencies or process improvements that will result in increased margins / lower costs the remaining budget should be evaluated against the expected benefits - an outside party might be able to give a more rational view on the benefit of finishing such projects as the management team might have a whole lot of other reasons to not want to walk away from it. (see sunk cost fallacy above)</li>
								</ul>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">Improving the cash flow cycle</h5>
								<div className="row">
									<div className="col-md-4">
										<img src="images/cash-flow-cycle.jpg" alt="" />
									</div>
									<div className="col-md-8">
										<p className="hdng-16">This deals with money coming into and money going out of the business. The objective is to keep the cash in the business as long as possible, to give flexibility and options for guiding the business through a cash shortage.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">Paying suppliers later by negotiating credit terms or longer payment terms reduces the amount of working capital required for the time between receiving products or raw materials and selling those to customers.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">Getting customer payments in faster by reducing credit terms, getting upfront deposits, cash on delivery and similar terms also reduces the amount of working capital required.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">The ideal situation is obviously to get customer payments in before supplier payments become due. Critical metrics to monitor in this area are Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), Average Days Overdue, Collection Efficiency or similar.</p>
									</div>
								</div>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">Reducing inventory</h5>
								<p className="hdng-18">This applies only to companies that manufacture and have raw materials inventory, or to companies that hold stock of finished products / goods. Reducing inventory can have the following impacts:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>A reduction in working capital, freeing up more cash for other needs in the business</li>
									<li>A short term once-off cash boost if excess inventory can be sold as a promotion - especially if this clears out slow-moving or redundant SKUs.</li>
									<li>An increase in production lead times if raw materials are purchased just-in-time from suppliers</li>
									<li>A decrease in customer services levels if lower inventory results in stock-outs or longer lead times</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16">You should investigate production planning and manufacturing performance to see if improvements here can reduce the raw materials stock requirement without impacting customer service. Supply chain optimisation, sales forecast accuracy and product portfolio rationalisation are other areas where improvements can lower inventory requirements without impacting customer service.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">Reducing marketing costs</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Marketing costs is an easy target, but reductions here will result in less leads and lower sales volumes if the marketing engine (strategy, digital platforms) has been generating leads. If the marketing engine has not been generating leads, refer to Core Alignment strategies below for a structural fix while pausing the existing Marketing Spend (as it is not generating the impact it is supposed to).</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">Reducing headcount (staff numbers), salary increases and bonus payments</h5>
								<p className="hdng-18">Downsizing is a typical short-term cost reduction exercise, especially in service based or knowledge based companies where salaries make up a large portion of the overheads. The key risks in staff reduction are:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>It could leave the organisation under-resourced to deliver appropriate service and quality to existing customers</li>
									<li>It leaves the organisation with little or no capacity to grow if orders increase</li>
									<li>It negatively impacts the morale of the remaining staff (survivor’s guilt) which increases the difficulty in getting staff buy-in and motivation for other change initiatives (see below)</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16">Therefore a reduction in headcount should be done as a last resort, or if the organisation is clearly overstaffed.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Holding back salary increases and bonus payments are less severe interventions which could be used to mobilise staff commitment, but the morale impact should be carefully managed. Best practice in this regard is to visibly apply the same reductions to senior managers - refer to the public outcries that occur when highly paid CEOs take massive bonus payouts when companies downsize as examples of how not to do this.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">Reducing production costs</h5>
								<p className="hdng-18">The survey tests for production costs relative to competitors. Some of the considerations are:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>If there is price parity with competitors and the market is not price sensitive, reducing production costs will result in additional margin for growth or in the case where the business is not surviving, keep it on the playing field.</li>
									<li>If your client is in a commodity market having lower production costs than the competitors and being able to compete on price will help the business survive while other less cost efficient competitors fail and exit the market. In other words your client’s business outlasts the other competitors because they have more cash and can survive a price war for longer.</li>
									<li>A reduction in production costs can lead to a reduction in quality, which could be problematic if quality differentiation is a core part of the differentiated customer value proposition</li>
									<li>Reduction in production costs could be achieved through other operational efficiency projects (automation, industrial process optimisation) but these are more long-term initiatives that would require investment, which could be problematic for a business that is in trouble</li>
									<li>A product/service portfolio review looking at the margin vs cost for each of those lines might identify opportunities to drop high-cost low-margin or high-intensity low-margin products with associated reductions in production cost (equipment, staff, raw materials, etc.)</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>TIP:</b> Production cost optimisation is a core ongoing task of any business. Clarity about the business model canvas is a useful tool to understand</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>What is the actual value proposition?</li>
									<li>What are the costs of the activities are to produce the value proposition?</li>
									<li>What do customers really want and how much are they willing to pay for it?</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16">It might be that customer research identifies expensive-to-add features / benefits that customers do not care for, and that can be removed without a loss in sales, resulting in a reduction in production costs</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">Reworking the company’s capital structure</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">This strategy essentially looks at the company’s balance sheet</p>
								<p className="hdng-18">On the Liabilities side cash availability can be impacted by</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Taking on additional debt/loans</li>
									<li>Restructuring high-cost debt</li>
									<li>Applying cash to loans to reduce interest payments</li>
									<li>Negotiating with creditors to postpone or reduce loan repayments if the business is in trouble (from a creditor’s point of view this is often preferable to the company defaulting and them having to write off the debt)</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-18">On the Assets side available cash can be increased through</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Selling shares to bring in cash</li>
									<li>Calling up investments or long-term deposits</li>
									<li>Digging into reserves</li>
									<li>Grants or other growth funding sources of cash</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16">This should be done in conjunction with someone who is skilled at financial re-engineering.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">Asset retrenchment</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Asset retrenchment often happens together with cost reduction initiatives, or shortly after, and could be considered a short-term strategy. Asset retrenchment is directly linked to asset utilisation, which is something that every company should be measuring. The two options in this space are essentially two sides of the same coin.</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Improve utilisation of existing assets is usually associated with increasing throughput through additional sales, but it can also be accomplished by renting out the spare capacity, e.g. allow other companies to use vehicles, manufacturing capability, warehouse space, office space etc.</li>
									<li>Disposing of underutilised assets will generate additional cash, depending on the nature and age of the asset and the state of the market. This will also improve the Return one Capital Employed (RCE) as the total asset value on the balance sheet is reduced. This indicator is one of the considerations that banks and investors take into account when evaluating funding proposals.</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-18">On the Assets side available cash can be increased through</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Selling shares to bring in cash</li>
									<li>Calling up investments or long-term deposits</li>
									<li>Digging into reserves</li>
									<li>Grants or other growth funding sources of cash</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16">This should be done in conjunction with someone who is skilled at financial re-engineering.</p>

										<p className="hdng-16">The three questions in Core Alignment can be closely linked to the Five Choices framework from the Play to Win approach to strategy. We recommend that you review the Growth Accelerator Consultants Manual for a more detailed explanation of this framework.</p>
									</div>
								</div>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">Where to play</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">The first question deals with opportunities for growth or turnaround through targeting specific markets products and customers. In order to implement this the client would need to at the least have a good understanding (or do some analysis) of their current products and markets and customers, and then enhance this by application of various market segmentation tools and techniques (e.g. the Anshoff Matrix)</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">How to win</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">The second question asks if the business can turn itself around by improving its competitive strategy through focusing on marketing and customers. Although it sounds similar to the first, it brings the competitive position into the evaluation. This means the client needs to have a good understanding (or do some research) of their competitors and the dominant market differentiation for their target markets and customers (i.e. price, service, quality, reputation, customer experience or any number of other differentiators).</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The second step in gaining improvements from this would be to review the current marketing engine to ensure that it is targeting the correct customers with the correct messaging about competitive differentiation in the channels where our target customers are looking for solutions - i.e. our product or service is better than the competitors because…</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">Capabilities and resources</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">This question essentially asks if the business has maximised its share of wallet with its existing customers. It is broadly linked to having the right capabilities, systems and metrics in place to ensure maximum cross selling, upselling, retention, return business and referrals from existing customers.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">Resource and Team Management</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">Resource and Team management checks if the business has the correct leadership in place to execute a turnaround, and if the culture would be supportive of attempts to change the course of the business and/or implement hard decisions required for short term survival.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The two questions in this section is by no means sufficient to make a decision about the topic of management, leadership and culture, and are mostly useful for triggering a conversation or deeper investigation into this area.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">Management team</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">As per the text in the survey report, a turnaround often requires the replacement of the CEO and/or members of the top management team (TMT). This could be a result of the existing TMT having firm beliefs about the business and the market which are incorrect, resulting in the business ending up where it is. There might also be resistance to changing past decisions which were poor in hindsight.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Additionally new people on the TMT or in the CEO position might bring different insights about the market, and other skills needed to turn the business around and implement new systems, processes or other changes required to run the business in its changing configuration.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">Staff support and culture</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>TIP:</b> Culture is a word that has been heavily overused, and has come to mean many different things to many people. In this context we choose to define it as the behaviours that the people in the company exhibit. These behaviours are the outcomes of what is encouraged or discouraged by leaders through formal values and metrics, and through their informal day-to-day behaviours.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Any business that attempts to implement a significant change (such as might be required by a turnaround plan) relies heavily on the support of its employees for implementing such changes.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">If the employees are disengaged, negative or suffering from change fatigue (too many changes in rapid succession) any attempt to implement changes would have to focus a lot of time and energy on change management.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">If the employees are aligned with the company values and purpose, and are supportive of the new direction the leadership wants to take with the turnaround program, they will contribute their energy and creativity to help the program to succeed in its objectives.</p>

										<img src="images/business-continuity.jpg" alt="" />
									</div>
									<div className="col-md-8">
										<p className="hdng-16">The second section of the survey evaluates business continuity against six risk areas. The thinking here is that an risk evaluation in these six areas might firstly explain why the business has ended up in need of a turnaround, and also whether there are longer term structural risks which threaten the sustainability of the business.</p>
										<p className="hdng-16">In this dashboard a higher score means that there are no significant risks to that particular area of the business.</p>
										<p className="hdng-18">For each of these questions you should discuss the assessment with the supplier under the three broad headings of:</p>
										<ul className="site-ul">
											<li>If this is currently a problem, is it a short-term problem that will go away of its own accord, and if so what is our short term mitigation of the risk</li>
											<li>If this is currently a problem that will not go away in the short term (i.e. it is a systemic or structural risk), what should we change in our business model to adapt it to the new reality</li>
											<li>If this is not currently a problem, are there developments in the environment (PESTLE) that might cause it to be a problem in the longer term</li>
											<li>How will any changes we make to the business from our core alignment or cash reduction initiatives discussed above change the risk profile for this item.</li>
										</ul>
									</div>
								</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-18">Discuss low scores in any of the fields with your client along the following guidelines:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li><b>Sales performance:</b> not enough sales means that we cannot generate cash to keep the business going. Understand why customers have stopped buying from the business (changes in market demand, disruptive alternative solutions, competitors taking away market share)</li>
									<li><b>Sales performance:</b> not enough sales means that we cannot generate cash to keep the business going. Understand why customers have stopped buying from the business (changes in market demand, disruptive alternative solutions, competitors taking away market share)</li>
									<li><b>Supply:</b> if we are unable to get raw materials or finished products from our suppliers, or have long supply lead times, we cannot serve our customers and this will result in lost sales if they have alternative solutions available. In this instance we should look at changing suppliers, increasing our stock holding. A shortage in supply could also result in increased prices from suppliers, which will impact our margin if we are unable to pass those increases through to our customers</li>
									<li><b>Cash flow:</b> Limited or no cash means that the business is vulnerable to unforeseen external events, is not able to invest in growth, and is not in a position to leverage an opportunity when it comes along.</li>
									<li><b>Distribution channel:</b> Disruptions in our distribution channel means delays in our ability to meet our customer promises, or a complete inability to get our product / service to our customer (as before this will result in lost business and decreased sales). A review of alternate supply chains or forms of service delivery is critical if this disruption is systemic rather than incidental / short term. For ideas on how businesses deal with distribution channel disruption it is interesting to look how the retail and hospitality industries responded to the Covid-19 pandemic with home delivery, online purchasing etc.</li>
									<li><b>Human resources:</b> As discussed above the impact on morale and engagement from various other initiatives pose a risk to the business through the loss of key skills, capacity to produce and serve the customer, and engagement and motivation levels. There is a large body of research that demonstrate the positive impact of engagement and motivation on performance and bottom line profitability and low scores on this indicator should be addressed as a matter of urgency.</li>
									<li><b>Overheads:</b> This is linked to cash flow and profitability, and ultimately impact on the business’ license to operate, its reputation in the market, and the associated risk of being declared bankrupt or put under administration by its creditors. In many cases a pro-active approach to these challenges could create some breathing room with creditors. Other cost reduction initiatives such as moving to smaller or cheaper premises could also alleviate pressures on the overheads.</li>

							<h2 className="hdng">Managing a turnaround program</h2>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">Commercial considerations</h5>
								<p className="hdng-16">The nature of this questionnaire indicates that your client might already be highly cost conscious, and it could be difficult to convince them to allocate scarce cash to a consultant to help them implement changes. Alternate pricing mechanisms such as performance or outcome based payments & bonuses might be a more attractive alternative to your client.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">There is a significant brand risk to you as consultant in taking on a turnaround program, as failure could be blamed on your consulting work even if it is something that is out of your control. Before taking on this engagement you need to be sure that there is a reasonable chance of a successful turnaround - if the business has already failed or will fail in the near future irrespective of any effort you put into it, it would be better for yourself and the business to decline the opportunity.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">On the other side of this coin there are businesses and consultants who are great at helping businesses turn themselves around, and they have a reputation and brand that allows them to gain a lot of clients. There is also the mental and emotional rewards of saving a business with many or all the jobs that</p>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 className="hdng-h5">Project management</h5>
								<p className="hdng-18">Due to the complexity of the work that you will be doing with your client, we highly recommend the use of formal project management tools and techniques. These should include:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>A structured and accessible space for saving and sharing project documents, work in progress, analytical results etc.</li>
									<li>A shared and accessible project plan that covers the duration of the engagement and the core deliverables as well as the major tasks that contribute to reaching those deliverables</li>
									<li>Clear allocation of tasks and deadlines to the most appropriate staff members</li>
									<li>Regular (weekly or bi-weekly) tracking of progress vs plan and corrective action to catch up on overdue items</li>
									<li>A senior management steering committee that meets monthly or quarterly</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16">If your client has skills, tools and capacity in-house to assign a project manager to the project it would be ideal, provided that the leadership team has given sufficient power and status to that project manager to drive performance forward.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">In the absence of that you might consider doing the project management as part of your retainer. We highly recommend using a collaborative project management platform (Asana, monday.com, Clickup) to manage the project timelines and execution. Ensure that all the relevant staff have access to this tool and that you are reviewing progress formally and informally with them regularly.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Any large projects that come out of the Turnaround work (e.g. the implementation of a new ERP system, developing a new product, entering a new geography, merger and acquisition activity) require separate projects that are planned and controlled at the appropriate level of complexity to ensure adherence to timelines, budget and fit-for-purpose deliverables.</p>
