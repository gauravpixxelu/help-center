							<h2 className="hdng">Establishing the baseline</h2>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">If you are delivering this as part of an Enterprise / Supplier Development Program, it is imperative that you establish a baseline for the group to present to your sponsor. At the end of the program you then need to re-do the survey to demonstrate improvement. There are some thoughts about data interpretation further down in this section.</p>
								<p className="hdng-18">There are three opportunities to conduct the survey with your individual / direct clients:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Sending a link to the survey as part of the application and registration for the program</li>
									<li>As preparation for the first consulting session</li>
									<li>During your initial consultation</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>TIP:</b> Clients will have a wide range of assessments of the relatively subjective measures for each of the questions. Some will rate themselves overly harsh, based on the scope for possible improvements. Others will give themselves higher scores than they probably deserve. See below for strategies to deal with this.</p>

							<h2 className="hdng">Using the survey prior to starting the program</h2>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">The survey can be sent out as part of the program application process, if the corporate sponsor does not simply provide a list of target suppliers for participation. It can also be sent out to selected participants prior to the first session.</p>
								<p className="hdng-18">Some challenges that arise when suppliers do self-assessment are:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Ensuring that all suppliers complete the survey results (not relevant if the completed survey is a requirement to be selected for participation in the program)</li>
									<li>Inconsistent scoring of answers to the various questions</li>
									<li>Some suppliers might not be familiar with the terminology and might not understand the question, therefore giving an incorrect answer and skewing your baseline dataset</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">Session can refer to group sessions, individual sessions or webinars</p>
								<p className="hdng-18">Some benefits of this upfront data collection include:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Having a preliminary view of the level of skill and awareness in the program cohort, and being able to adjust the learning program</li>
									<li>Being able to adjust the program milestones and outcomes and manage expectations with the sponsor</li>
									<li>Ability to show each participant where they stand relative to the group as part of the program kick-off</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16">	If self-assessment is the chosen route, every supplier should receive their customised survey result report before their first session, and going through the report should be part of the agenda of the first session.</p>

							<h2 className="hdng">Using the survey as part of your initial consultation</h2>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">We strongly recommend that you have at least one individual session with the participating suppliers at the start of the program. <b>The first objective</b> of this GTKY (Getting to know you) session is to introduce yourself to the supplier, discuss the program content/schedule, objectives and goals, agree on logistics (contact hours, meeting frequency, channels of communication) and tell the supplier what the reporting and attendance requirements are, and outcomes / consequences of successful participation and non-participation</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">For many suppliers this might be the first time that they participate in an Enterprise / Supplier Development Program, or the first time that they are going through this specific program you are offering. They might range from excited and committed to the program, through to blasé and disinterested, especially if they are only attending the program in order to get access to preferential procurement or access to the sponsor’s supply chain.<b> The second objective</b> of your first session would therefore be to gauge their interest and commitment.</p>
								<p className="hdng-18">The third objective of this session is establishing trust and rapport. Going through the survey with the client in a discussion format has the following benefits:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Engaging the client in a question and response dialog format sets the tone and expectations for how the coaching relationship will work</li>
									<li>You start building trust with the client as the survey encourages them to disclose information about their business that they would not normally disclose to strangers</li>
									<li>You are able to explore why the client rates certain answers high and certain answers low, which gives you some ideas of where they see the opportunities, challenges and strong points of themselves, their teams and their business</li>
									<li>You can gently calibrate some of the answers towards more realistic assessments, by asking probing follow-up questions if the client is scoring consistently high or consistently low.</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-18">Some other types of questions that will be useful in this session could be:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li><b>Building rapport:</b> When did you start the business? What were your dreams and aspirations? Can you remember how it felt when you got payment on your first invoice? What were the things that made you leave your job (if they left the corporate environment to start their business)</li>
									<li><b>Business model and market:</b> What are your most successful product or service offerings ? Who is your biggest customer ? Which industry / market do you like working in most ?</li>
									<li><b>Current challenges:</b> What worries you most about your team ? Suppliers ? Financial performance? Market conditions? Geopolitical, social, environmental or other macro trends ?</li>
									<li><b>Strategic direction:</b> What do you plan to do with the business in 5 to 10 years ? How many people would you like to employ ? How much profit do you want to make in 5 to 10 years ?</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16">	The most important preparation you can do for this meeting is to cultivate an attitude of curiosity and attentive listening. This is not yet the time to give advice and instructions (it is probably never a good time to give instructions).</p>
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>TIP:</b> In this session consider using only your coaching skills, and leave your analytical mind behind the screen. Open, curious questions will elicit a lot of information that will be useful in your future work.</p>

							<h2 className="hdng">Analytical rigour</h2>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">As mentioned in the Business Builder Consultants manual, the subjective assessment of their own business will vary significantly from one supplier to the next. Over time you will form your own impressions of the true score for each area and what the types of questions are that would give you a better view of the actual situation.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">You will also be able to judge fairly rapidly if the supplier is overly harsh on themselves, or have a realistic view of their business, or are being overly generous in their assessment of themselves. This might be based on a lack of knowledge of the required skills and processes, a lack of deep reflection on the business, or simply protecting the ego if this is a supplier at the beginning of their journey.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">In the Business Builder training we advise that you have to decide for yourself if you wish to challenge the supplier’s assessment and potentially making it harder to build trust and rapport, or if you will use their assessment to deepen the conversation about core focus areas.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">If the suppliers completed the survey before the initial meeting, you can decide to adjust the baseline scores during the initial consultation, or keep the values as is and manage the close-out survey.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Which ever approach you choose for the program should be informed by the objectives and analytical culture of the program sponsor, and it is a good idea to manage their expectations about the quantitive vs qualitative nature and expected variation between suppliers in the baseline results up front - this is especially important if the surveys have been sent out and completed by the suppliers without your involvement.</p>

							<h2 className="hdng">Using the survey as a program look-back and close-out</h2>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">Enterprise and Supplier Development programs typically run for 6 to 12 months. At the end of the program you need to provide feedback to the sponsor on the impact that the program has made to suppliers. In the reporting section below we give some additional ideas, but one of the core components of your final report should be a check on how much the survey areas have improved.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Depending on the format of the program this could again take the form of self-assessment or a joint conversation as part of the final session.</p>

								<p className="hdng-18">Here are some considerations around the timing of the survey, and how to manage the responses:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>You will typically not see much progress in hard, measurable performance in the first 6 to 9 months. After six months you should have some short-term wins and some changes in tools, behaviors and other deliverables from working with the supplier</li>
									<li>After 12 months there should be real improvement in key measurements or KPIs which you will have established with the supplier, and these should start driving the business performance</li>
									<li>You should by now have a relationship built on trust, collaboration and rapport. The supplier will be much more open about the “dirty laundry in the back room” of the business, and your conversation will be much more intentional and productive than the first session</li>
									<li>With a deeper understanding of what appropriate and excellent performance looks like, the supplier might assess themselves lower than they did when they did not have the knowledge that you have been imparting to them</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">Taking all of this into account, we recommend that you have the original baseline assessment available, and compare the new results with the old ones. You could even use the baseline results as a prompt in the review by asking how much the supplier thinks they have improved the score since the baseline was done.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">If the supplier ranked themselves excessively high in the initial baseline, you could also turn the question around and ask them if they would now rank themselves lower than they did at the time when you started the engagement with them.</p>
								<p className="hdng-18">Either way it is useful to show the improvement. Capturing the baseline and new scores in a spreadsheet is a powerful demonstration of the actual improvement. If you are not going to continue working with this supplier in a new program after the end of the current program, the purpose of this exercise also includes:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Allowing the supplier to reflect on how much progress they have made and celebrating the wins</li>
									<li>Turning this into motivation for the supplier to continue improving and building on their achievements</li>
									<li>Getting realistic feedback scores from the supplier to the sponsor if a consultant feedback survey is part of closing out the program</li>
									<li>Creating a basis for you to engage the supplier as a paying private client post the program if that is not in conflict with any contractual arrangements you have with the sponsor</li>

							<h2 className="hdng">Program outline and structure</h2>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">This program has 12 modules, and should ideally be delivered over 12 months to allow suppliers to work on the content between sessions. It can be shortened by increasing the number of monthly contact events and supplier time commitment required per month.</p>
								<p className="hdng-18">Enterprise and Supplier Development programs typically require a rigorous and aligned curriculum and schedule for the following reasons:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>The program will typically have monthly reporting requirements for audit or compliance purposes</li>
									<li>There is a high level of complexity in managing multiple suppliers in different parts of the program at the same time</li>
									<li>Some of the skills building (lecture mode) can be done through group format events such as webinars or videos.</li>
									<li>Covering the same content with every supplier during the course of the month allows you to assess and report on the progress of all the suppliers more consistently</li>
									<li>It is easier to align sponsor attendance and support (e.g. mentor meetings, site visits) to the current topic</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">It is therefore recommended that you deliver the program modules in the sequence it is presented on the learning portal.</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>The first half of the program is fairly knowledge intensive and introduces many tools and concepts to the supplier. There is also a lot of research and thinking required to get the information needed to build an irresistible offer.</li>
									<li>The second half of the program revisits many of the concepts in the first half, and string them together into access to market strategies and offers. It also adds additional nuance to the concepts discovered in the first half of the program.</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>NOTE:</b> Later modules often build on and revisit concepts from earlier modules, so it is important that suppliers do the homework and continue to work on the outputs of previous modules.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Each of the modules comprise of a short video that goes through the presentation. It is recommended that your suppliers watch this video as pre-work to the session so that you can use your time clarifying questions, and driving towards the implementation action that follows the insights or learning. You can use the goal settings and activity summary in the portal to track these, or any other program management tool that you have agreed on with the sponsor (see below).</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The first 6 modules on the portal has an additional tools document, which contain blank templates for use with your suppliers. You can also use templates or slides from the presentation with your suppliers.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16"><p>TIP:</p> The program is highly focused on business growth through the use of marketing and sales tools, techniques and analysis. It should be said that no business will succeed without managing operations, people and cash effectively, no matter how attractive and effective their branding, marketing systems, processes and digital promotion engine and sales processes are.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">If the growth challenge does not lie in attracting and converting leads into sales, but in effective delivery of the value proposition and optimally capturing the created value, then this program is not suitable for the supplier or your individual client, and they will be better served by a program such as the Business Builder.</p>

								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li><b>Organisational life cycle:</b> the stages of growth as presented in Leaping the Chasm by Geoffrey Moore. Depending on the current state of the supplier, a conversation about the difference between innovators and early adopters vs mass market acceptance might unlock insights about the barriers to growth.</li>
									<li><b>Business model:</b>The Business Model Canvas is covered in depth in other modules, and it is important for the suppliers to understand what the revenue and cost drivers for their company is, and what levers they could pull to increase it. This course focuses mainly on the right hand side of the canvas</li>
									<li><b>Product market fit:</b> four simple questions that all have to be “yes” for a business to succeed. A significant portion of startup businesses that fail do so because they don not have true product market fit.</li>
									<li><b>Sales conversion process:</b> the underlying concept of a marketing / sales pipeline. It is sometimes useful to simplify the terms to demystify them and make them more accessible to the suppliers. Marketing = building awareness and trust that leads to an enquiry. Sales = understanding the customer needs and matching those to the product or service that your supplier’s company can offer, or refer them somewhere else if they are not the correct solution. Very few suppliers in the small business space are aware of this funnel and even fewer measure the throughput and conversion rates they achieve.</li>
									<li><b>Retention and growth:</b> It is significantly cheaper in terms of time and resources to sell to return customers, compared to finding new customers if the nature of the product / service allows for recurring business. Most companies do not actively nurture or measure repeating and referring business.</li>
									<li><b>Profitable growth model:</b> A reasonably comprehensive systems model of the growth process linking various components of the business model canvas, product market fit and marketing / sales process to data analytics and metrics and decision points.</li>

								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>TIP:</b>As the supplier is sponsored to be in the program, they might see your role as getting them more business from the sponsor. Although this is nice to have, you might also believe that you have an ethical obligation to the supplier participants to help them grow their business into more sustainable entities. One of the signs of a de-risked, sustainable business is that they are not dependent on one key customer for their survival (a diversified customer and product / services portfolio) We therefore encourage you to always push the supplier to look for growth outside of their current and future business with the program sponsor. Manage this dual drive for greater dependence and work with the sponsor and strategic diversification with great care.</p>

								<p className="hdng-16"><b>TIP: </b>Suppliers often think that the objective of cold calling or calling existing customers is to sell them something. Remind them that the purpose of an unsolicited call to a potential customer is to get time to discuss the product or solution, or to build a relationship. Calls to existing clients that have bought product from the company recently could be to ask for feedback on the product or service, checking if they need more of those, introducing new features or benefits and a myriad other reasons to talk to the customer.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>ANOTHER TIP:</b> We highly recommend that all business owners and their sales staff invest in basic sales skills training around making cold calls and pitching the company and its products / services. We also recommend preparing, scripting and rehearsing 30 second, 60 second and 5 minute cold call scripts, customer presentations, business networking introductions, trade show messages, product demonstration scripts and other verbal and physical presentation tools that the sales team or business owner has ready for whichever opportunity they come across.</p>

								<p className="hdng-16">Corporate Procurement Roles</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Given that the context of many Enterprise and Supplier Development programs have as one of the objectives increased access to corporate supply chains, it might be useful to introduce the suppliers to the concept of customer profiling when talking about proposal success (see the Business Builder module for more in-depth discussion and tools).
									Of relevance to suppliers are the idea that consumers typically have one person making the buying decision and using the product. On the other hand Corporates often have multiple people/roles involved in the buying decision. Understanding these roles will help suppliers have the right discussions with the right person.</p>
								<p className="hdng-18">These roles are typically:</p>
								<p className="hdng-18">Technical buyer:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>The person who understands the problem that the organization is trying to solve,</li>
									<li>Technical buyers often work in operational functions such as Marketing, Logistics, Manufacturing and could be buying products or services (e.g. raw materials, transport, web design).</li>
									<li>They could also be working in support functions such as Facilities, Finance, Human Resources and are then more likely to look for outsourced or specialized services (e.g. audit, staff training)</li>
									<li>They are most likely to be interested in understanding the supplier’s Value Proposition and how it is a better problem-solution fit than the competition</li>
									<li>They have a major impact in including / excluding supplier products and services on the basis of fit-for-purpose, through the specifications they pass to Procurement</li>
									<li>They might influence the buying decision if there are clear differences between short term cost savings and longer term benefits from investing in more expensive products / service (the total cost of ownership or life-cycle cost conversations)</li>
									<li>Their objective is to get a fit-for-purpose solution that meets quality, safety and productivity requirements, and conversations with them should cover these topics, innovation and other topics that relate to the product and service.</li>
								</ul>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-18">Economic buyer (Procurement):</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>In most corporates this function is done by either Finance or Procurement, and this is the person that makes the actual purchase decision and/or supplier selection</li>
									<li>They are likely to use procurement processes such as RFP (Request for Proposal), RFQ (Request for Quote), tendering, supplier selection and shortlisting and other supplier management processes</li>
									<li>They might be trained and incentivized in negotiation techniques which are aimed at reducing prices, and pose a major risk to supplier margins</li>
									<li>In the vast majority of cases their goal is to save the company money and they have little or no interest in product features and supplier performance other than meeting the minimum requirements determined by the technical buyer, although some more progressive Procurement officers would be looking at life-time cost-to-company and might be receptive to price vs quality and longevity proposals</li>

									<li>In most cases they have a compliance process to follow - it is imperative for the suppliers to understand where they have room to propose alternate solutions, and other techniques for differentiating themselves from competitors in the procurement process.</li>
									<li>In more mature / advanced companies Procurement often have responsibility for measuring and enforcing Service Level Agreements (SLA) and would obtain quantitative and qualitative data from the End User in that case.</li>

								<p className="hdng-18">End User:</p>

									<li>They typically have production targets that are put in jeopardy by failures in the supplier products and services, or supply chain problems in the suppliers such as stock-outs, late delivery, poor quality etc.</li>
									<li>They would be most interested in ease of use, fit for purpose, reliability and service from the supplier</li>
									<li>End users typically have little or no role in the supplier selection decision, and they might often be the person placing the actual order for delivery to stock or operations.</li>

									<li>They might have inputs in determining and measuring Service Level Agreements (SLA) together with the technical buyer, and might able to influence the technical buyer or economic buyer on the basis of reliability, emergency service and other operational needs - it is imperative for suppliers to understand their role and leverage it</li>
									<li>Also note that the end user is typically where the majority of the customer journey touchpoints are experienced, and where poor service can make or break the supplier reputation and growth aspirations or lead to cancellation of the supply contract through Procurement.</li>

								<p className="hdng-16">The final module in the program is a motivational speech for business owners and entrepreneurs, and encourages them to also look at reinventing themselves as a person, with a focus on goals, development, renewal and growth. It is possible that this would form part of the last session of the series, so there might be some program wrap-up tasks to add to the agenda (see below)</p>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">The Business Builder Consultant manual has an entire chapter with tips on how to manage the logistics and meetings / content of the consulting process. We strongly recommend you familiarise yourself with that content.</p>

							<h2 className="hdng">Session format and Frequency</h2>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-18">Depending on the sponsor requirements and willingness to pay, sessions can be conducted online or in person, and the format can a blend of one or more of the following:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Group sessions: these are working sessions where more than one participant engages with the module - this would typically cover the analysis and homework as well as checking understanding. It could also have a lecture component where the content is presented to the group. Such sessions could happen once or twice per month with a duration of 1 - 3 hours per session.</li>
									<li>Webinars: online lectures that present the content - this could be done in lieu of asking the participants to watch the videos on the portal, and has the benefit of being able to monitor and track attendance and answer questions about the content. They differ from group sessions in that there is no active work and discussion about the specific supplier action plan. We recommend that webinars are kept to 30 minutes. Webinars could be repeated multiple times to allow more suppliers to attend - we recommend one during business hours and one after hours.</li>
									<li>Individual sessions: We recommend a minimum of 2 hours per month individual contact time and could be scheduled as one long session or two 1-hour sessions.</li>
									<li>Office hours: these short calls have a duration of maximum 20 minutes, and typically serve to answer one or two questions that the supplier might have, or check in on progress. They are interspersed between other sessions and could be scheduled or on request by the supplier.</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16">In general we recommend contact with the supplier at least twice per month, to maintain momentum and encourage the supplier to work on the tasks. If multiple meetings are not possible due to time or budget constraints, other tools such as WhatsApp, Slack, email, short phone calls etc. should be used to remain in contact with the suppliers individually as well as in a group.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Please read the section in the Business Builder manual about the use of online scheduling portals with email and SMS reminders to reduce the administration of setting up sessions with suppliers. Alternatively you can create a standing weekly or monthly schedule and simply inform suppliers when they are expected to attend - this is the recommended approach for webinars and group sessions, but could also work for individual sessions.</p>

							<h2 className="hdng">Supplier onboarding and GTKY</h2>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-18">The goals of the first meeting are:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Completing the baseline survey if this has not been done before the session and going through the results with the supplier.</li>
									<li>Setting expectations from yourself and the sponsor about ways of working, participation and attendance and the consequences / rewards linked to these (if any), and making the supplier aware of what is being reported to the sponsor</li>
									<li>Starting to build trust and rapport with the supplier — you will need this later on when you need to help them discover and deal with unpleasant truths about their business models, staff members, own behaviours and assumptions, etc.</li>
									<li>Getting an understanding of the supplier’s preferred styles (detailed vs high level, cautious vs adventurous, data driven), how do they balance emotions and logic, what are their values around people, customers, etc.</li>
									<li>Get to know how the supplier’s business functions at a high level — how do they make money, how many people do they have, what is their geographic scope, what are their target markets, products and services, current challenges, cash position, sales pipeline health etc. Some of these might be reported to the sponsor in an aggregate form, but ensure that suppliers are comfortable with sharing sensitive information such as profit, cash position, sales pipeline and target customers with the sponsor before doing so.</li>
									<li>Building rapport: When did you start the business ? What were your dreams and aspirations ? Can you remember how it felt when you got payment on your first invoice ? What were the things that made you leave your job (if they left the corporate environment to start their business)</li>
									<li>Business model and market: What are your most successful product or service offerings ? Who is your biggest customer? Which industry / market do you like working in most ?</li>
									<li>Current challenges: What worries you most about your team ? Suppliers? Financial performance? Market conditions? Geopolitical, social, environmental or other macro trends ?</li>
									<li>Strategic direction: What do you plan to do with the business in 5 to 10 years ? How many people would you like to employ? How much profit do you want to make in 5 to 10 years ?</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16">The most important preparation you can do for this meeting is to cultivate an attitude of curiosity and attentive listening. This is not yet the time to give advice and instructions (it is probably never a good time to give instructions).</p>

							<h2 className="hdng">Execution plan and tracking</h2>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-18">Some consultants find it useful to split strategy development into the two activities of</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Strategic thinking: what is our vision, purpose, and values; where do we want to go with the business in the medium and long term; what are our priorities and challenges that we need to overcome; where and how do we generate growth, etc.</li>
									<li>Execution planning: what projects, tasks, initiatives do we need to execute in the next 3 to 12 months to move us closer to our goals; how will we measure success on these initiatives; who will be accountable for delivering them; what conversations will we have every month to ensure that we remain on track.</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16">Agree with the supplier how the execution plan will be created and updated with progress and new actions. The goals and activities tracker in the LMS portal, shared spreadsheets or documents, collaborative project management portals, paper based systems or any other format that works for both parties could be applied. It is important that the supplier owns and uses the execution plan for the program.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Closing out session</h5>
								<p className="hdng-18">The final session in the program might be combined with the last module (Reinventing yourself) or might be a separate session. The goals of this session are:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Complete and discuss a final benchmark score - as discussed above, doing this with the supplier allows you to get a true version of progress by either asking for improvement against the baseline score, or re-assessing the current status and lowering the baseline score if it was uninformed or over-optimistic. The trust that you have built with the supplier will enable a much more realistic assessment of the final score</li>
									<li>Do a look-back exercise with the supplier to identify and celebrate progress made during the program (this can be done as part of the exit survey)</li>
									<li>Ask the supplier for feedback about the program and your own interaction (this could be done as a separate survey using online survey tools</li>
									<li>Encourage the supplier to identify goals and objectives for the next 12 months to continue to build on / implement the learnings and concepts from the program</li>
									<li>If this is the end of your engagement with the supplier, thank them for working with you and trusting you, and ask them for referrals, testimonials or similar inputs on LinkedIn or other portals that help you market your own business.</li>
								</ul>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Optionally</h5>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>If there is a follow up program where you will continue to work with the supplier, discuss any next steps</li>
									<li>If the program has come to an end, and if it is allowed by your own code of ethics as well as any potential restraint of trade clauses in the contract with the sponsor, you could offer to continue coaching the supplier in a private capacity where they would be paying your normal commercial rates</li>

							<h2 className="hdng">Reporting and meetings with the Sponsor</h2>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">As part of your engagement you will have agreed a reporting framework with the sponsor. Note that some suppliers might not want to share sensitive/confidential information with the sponsor, so either share it in an aggregate form where it cannot be traced back to the supplier, or ensure that you have permission from the supplier to share it
									We would also recommend meetings with the supplier program office and key staff in the relevant departments and supply chain if possible</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Monthly reports</h5>
								<p className="hdng-18">It is mandatory that you submit <b>monthly reports </b>to the sponsor. Typical contents cover</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Supplier attendance and participation</li>
									<li>A short description of the topic of the month and optionally some of the key discoveries and issues that suppliers have shared during their sessions (taking confidentiality into account)</li>
									<li>Any data that you collected during the month (survey results, supplier cash position, number of employees, etc.)</li>
									<li>A short indication of the next steps and milestones or the topic for the next month.</li>
								</ul>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Program close-out report</h5>
								<p className="hdng-18">At the end of the program you should submit a<b> program close-out report,</b> that covers</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>A brief recap of the program learning objectives</li>
									<li>A summary of supplier attendance and participation</li>
									<li>A comparison of survey baseline and final scores, including some discussion of the areas where there has been most improvement and areas where there have been little improvement with some subjective reasons for those</li>
									<li>Feedback on the program that the suppliers have shared - what they appreciated and areas for improvement</li>
									<li>Opportunities for a next program or how to continue to support the suppliers (this is part of the sales process, and is not relevant if a further phase to the program has already been agreed on by the sponsor)</li>
								</ul>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<h5 class="hdng-h5">Sponsor meetings</h5>
								<p className="hdng-18">It would be very helpful if the sponsor agrees to meetings with yourself and the suppliers. Objectives of such meetings could include</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Monthly or quarterly check-in about the program progress, to discuss the monthly reports and answer questions or address concerns from the sponsor</li>
									<li>Meetings between specific subject matter experts, departments or teams in the sponsor and the supplier, to help the supplier understand the customer needs of the sponsor, address shortcomings in supplier performance or help the supplier improve their performance, or to train the supplier(s) on the customer processes (e.g. how to submit a correct invoice). You could optionally attend these meetings as the consultant to observe how the supplier interacts with the sponsor for later coaching, and to assist the supplier to turn the feedback into actionable items.</li>
									<li>Meetings with the Procurement and other relevant functions in the sponsor, to feed back issues that suppliers might be facing or identify areas for improvement (reduced payment terms, split payments, feedback on failed tenders / RFP etc)</li>
