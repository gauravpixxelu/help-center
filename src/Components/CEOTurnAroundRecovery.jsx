													<h4>Cost Efficiencies Strategy</h4>
													<p className="hdng-16">Cost efficiencies include a varied range of actions, which can all be characterised as “belt-tightening” or “fire-fighting”, with the aim of producing “quick-wins” in order to either stabilise finances in the short-term until more complex strategies are devised or to quickly improve cash flow.</p>

													<h4>Asset Retrenchment</h4>
													<p className="hdng-16">Asset retrenchment is often pursued in concert with, or immediately following a cost-efficiency drive. An asset retrenchment strategy is where areas of the firm that are underperforming are appraised to determine if efficiencies can be made, or whether it is best to divest the asset completely rather than allowing it to continue operating at a weaker level than the rest of the firm.</p>

													<p className="hdng-16">A focus on the firm’s core activities is a strategy that entails determining the markets, products, and customers that have the potential to generate the greatest profits and refocusing the firm’s activities on these areas. Successful turnarounds have been associated with a focus on product lines for which the firm is best known, customer segments that are particularly loyal or less price-sensitive, and areas where the firm has distinct competitive strength.</p>

								<p className="hdng-16">This manual is aimed at business owners and management teams who wish to use the Red3Sixty Turnaround and Recovery Assessment (TRA) in their business. The Turnaround and Recovery Assessment is aimed at businesses who are experiencing reclining or flat sales revenues, with an associated decline in profitability, and businesses who are already in a sustained loss-making position. The assessment will identify opportunities for a Turnaround, which the business can then implement. The assessment should be conducted with the senior business leadership team. The advice of qualified financial, legal and other practitioners should be sought if the business is already in crisis mode when starting with this work.</p>

								<p className="hdng-16">The first set of survey results point to four “buckets” of actions and strategies to generate more cash in the business. Two of these buckets are more short-term in nature, and two are more structural and require medium / longer term re-alignment or restructuring of the business. It should be noted that a higher score in these results indicate greater opportunities for improvement and the colours of the graphs should be interpreted from the point of view of how far away the business is from having executed all possible turnaround strategies. In other words, RED means that there are many opportunities to turn the business around, and green means that all possible levers have been pulled.</p>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">Cost efficiencies focus on immediate actions to improve cash flow or reduce costs. As described in the survey results these are firefighting or belt-tightening exercises. Work through these with your team to identify if there is a need for a structured cost-reduction project. The key danger in cost reduction programs is to cut too deeply, leaving the organisation unable to survive. Ensure that you discuss the direct short-term and long-term impacts of cost reduction with your team.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>TIP:</b>Beware of the sunk cost fallacy. A sunk cost is any cost that’s already been invested and can’t be retrieved. The sunk cost fallacy (sometimes called the lost cost fallacy or trap) is a cognitive bias that causes people to stick with a plan, course, or approach that isn’t working because of how much has already been invested in it. Investment here can mean money, time, effort, or all three. Some examples of cost reduction activities that can have unintended consequences are discussed below</p>

								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>If your business is in a sector or industry where R&D is a critical success factor or competitive advantage (e.g. technology, pharmaceuticals) cost reductions could lead to the business eventually failing due to obsolescence</li>
									<li>If the R&D expenditure is driving operational efficiencies or process improvements that will result in increased margins / lower costs the remaining budget should be evaluated against the expected benefits - an outside party might be able to give a more rational view on the benefit of finishing such projects as the management team might have a whole lot of other reasons to not want to walk away from it.

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">Downsizing is a typical short-term cost reduction exercise, especially in service based or knowledge based companies where salaries make up a large portion of the overheads. The key risks in staff reduction are</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>It could leave the organisation under-resourced to deliver appropriate service and quality to existing customers</li>
									<li>It leaves the organisation with little or no capacity to grow if orders increase</li>
									<li>It negatively impacts the morale of the remaining staff (survivor’s guilt) which increases the difficulty in getting staff buy-in and motivation for other change initiatives (see below)</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16">Therefore a reduction in headcount should be done as a last resort, or if the organisation is clearly overstaffed. Holding back salary increases and bonus payments are less severe interventions which could be used to mobilise staff commitment, but the morale impact should be carefully managed. Best practice in this regard is to visibly apply the same reductions to senior managers - refer to the public outcries that occur when highly paid CEOs take massive bonus payouts when companies downsize as examples of how not to do this.</p>

									<li>If there is price parity with competitors and the market is not price sensitive, reducing production costs will result in additional margin for growth or in the case where the business is not surviving, keep it on the playing field.</li>
									<li>If your business is in a commodity market having lower production costs than the competitors and being able to compete on price will help the business survive while other less cost efficient competitors fail and exit the market. In other words your business outlasts the other competitors because you have more cash and can survive a price war for longer.</li>
									<li>A reduction in production costs can lead to a reduction in quality, which could be problematic if quality differentiation is a core part of the differentiated customer value proposition</li>
									<li>reduction in production costs could be achieved through other operational efficiency projects (automation, industrial process optimisation) but these are more long-term initiatives that would require investment, which could be problematic for a business that is in trouble</li>
									<li>A product/service portfolio review looking at the margin vs cost for each of those lines might identify opportunities to drop high-cost low-margin or high-intensity low-margin products with associated reductions in production cost (equipment, staff, raw materials, etc.)</li>

								<p className="hdng-16">Asset retrenchment often happens together with cost reduction initiatives, or shortly after, and could be considered a short-term strategy. Asset retrenchment is directly linked to asset utilisation, which is something that every company should be measuring. The two options in this space are essentially two sides of the same coin</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Improve utilisation of existing assets is usually associated with increasing throughput through additional sales, but it can also be accomplished by renting out the spare capacity, e.g. allow other companies to use vehicles, manufacturing capability, warehouse space, office space etc.</li>
									<li>disposing of underutilised assets will generate additional cash, depending on the nature and age of the asset and the state of the market. This will also improve the Return one Capital Employed (RCE) as the total asset value on the balance sheet is reduced. This indicator is one of the considerations that banks and investors take into account when evaluating funding proposals.</li>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">The first question deals with opportunities for growth or turnaround through targeting specific markets products and customers. In order to implement this you would need to at the very least have a good understanding (or do some product / customer portfolio profitability analysis) of your current products and markets and customers, and then enhance this by application of various market segmentation tools and techniques (e.g. the Anshoff Matrix)</p>

								<p className="hdng-16">The second question asks if the business can turn itself around by improving its competitive strategy through focusing on marketing and customers. Although it sounds similar to the first, it brings the competitive position into the evaluation. This means you need to have a good understanding (or do some research) on your competitors and the dominant market differentiation for your target markets and customers (i.e. price, service, quality, reputation, customer experience or any number of other differentiators). The second step in gaining improvements from this would be to review the current marketing engine to ensure that it is targeting the correct customers with the correct messaging about competitive differentiation in the channels where your target customers are looking for solutions - i.e. your product or service is better than the competitors because …</p>

The two questions in this section is by no means sufficient to make a decision about the topic of management, leadership and culture, and are mostly useful for triggering a conversation or deeper investigation into this area.</p>

							<h2 className="hdng">Management team</h2>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">As per the text in the survey report, a turnaround often requires the replacement of the CEO and/or members of the top management team (TMT). This could be a result of the existing TMT having firm beliefs about the business and the market which are incorrect, resulting in the business ending up where it is. There might also be resistance to changing past decisions which were poor in hindsight. Additionally new people on the TMT or in the CEO position might bring different insights about the market, and other skills needed to turn the business around and implement new systems, processes or other changes required to run the business in its changing configuration.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">	<b>TIP:</b> It is very unusual for founders who have a high entrepreneurial drive to also be good CEOs, as the skills required to drive innovation are not necessarily the same as the skills required to run and direct a large, complex company. Many larger companies will hire qualified and professional CEOs or COOs to take over the running of the company and free up the founder’s time to focus on their core skills and passions. In smaller companies this conversation about having the right skills in the Top Management Teams will by its nature be very sensitive and also subject to a large amount of bias (blind spots) and sensitivity about inter-personal relationships. The use of external facilitators to evaluate if there is a need for, and then support the design, recruitment and implementation of a new TMT is therefore highly recommended.</p>

In this context we choose to define it as the behaviours that the people in the company exhibit. These behaviours are the outcomes of what is encouraged or discouraged by leaders through formal values and metrics, and through their informal day-to-day behaviours. </p>
								<p className="hdng-16">	Any business that attempts to implement a significant change (such as might be required by a turnaround plan) relies heavily on the support of its employees for implementing such changes. If the employees are disengaged, negative or suffering from change fatigue (too many changes in rapid succession) any attempt to implement changes would have to focus a lot of time and energy on change management. If the employees are aligned with the company values and purpose, and are supportive of the new direction the leadership wants to take with the turnaround program, they will contribute their energy and creativity to help the program to succeed in its objectives.</p>

							<h2 className="hdng">Business Continuity</h2>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">The second section of the survey evaluates business continuity against six risk areas. The thinking here is that an risk evaluation in these six areas might firstly explain why the business has ended up in need of a turnaround, and also whether there are longer term structural risks which threaten the sustainability of the business</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">In this dashboard a higher score means that there are no significant risks to that particular area of the business.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">For each of these questions you should discuss the assessment with your team under the four broad headings of:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>If this is currently a problem, is it a short-term problem that will go away of its own accord, and if so what is our short term mitigation of the risk</li>
									<li>If this is currently a problem that will not go away in the short term (i.e. it is a systemic or structural risk), what should we change in our business model to adapt it to the new reality</li>
									<li>If this is not currently a problem, are there developments in the environment (PESTLE) that might cause it to be a problem in the longer term</li>
									<li>how will any changes we make to the business from our core alignment or cash reduction initiatives discussed above change the risk profile for this item.</li>
								</ul>

							</div>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">Discuss low scores in any of the fields with your team along the following guidelines:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Sales performance: not enough sales means that we cannot generate cash to keep the business going. Understand why customers have stopped buying from the business (changes in market demand, disruptive alternative solutions, competitors taking away market share)</li>
									<li>Supply: if we are unable to get raw materials or finished products from our suppliers, or have long supply lead times, we cannot serve our customers and this will result in lost sales if they have alternative solutions available. In this instance we should look at changing suppliers, increasing our stock holding. A shortage in supply could also result in increased prices from suppliers, which will impact our margin if we are unable to pass those increases through to our customers. If this is a systemic supply problem and all your competitors are experiencing the same challenge, there is both an opportunity and an urgent imperative for disruptive innovation to solve the customer problem in new and innovative ways.</li>
									<li>Distribution channel: Disruptions in your distribution channel means delays in your ability to meet your customer promises, or a complete inability to get your product / service to your customer (as before this will result in lost business and decreased sales). A review of alternate supply chains or forms of service delivery is critical if this disruption is systemic rather than incidental / short term. For ideas on how businesses deal with distribution channel disruption it is interesting to look how the retail and hospitality industries responded to the Covid-19 pandemic with home delivery, online purchasing etc.</li>
									<li>Human resources: As discussed above the impact on morale and engagement from various other initiatives pose a risk to the business through the loss of key skills, capacity to produce and serve the customer, and engagement and motivation levels. There is a large body of research that demonstrate the positive impact of engagement and motivation on performance and bottom line profitability and low scores on this indicator should be addressed as a matter of urgency.</li>
									<li>Overheads: This is linked to cash flow and profitability, and ultimately impact on the business’ license to operate, its reputation in the market, and the associated risk of being declared bankrupt or put under administration by its creditors. In many cases a pro-active approach to these challenges could create some breathing room with creditors. Other cost reduction initiatives such as moving to smaller or cheaper premises could also alleviate pressures on the overheads.</li>
