								<p className="hdng-16"><b>TIP: </b>There are no right or wrong answers in the survey, and it is not an exam that gives you a pass/fail mark. The intention of the baseline survey is to help you identify the areas where your business are weak, and help you prioritise the order in which you will tackle improvement initiatives and projects.</p>

								<p className="hdng-16">Link the lower scores together to identify the core challenge that the business is facing.

							<h2 className="hdng">Using the survey as periodic look-back and redirect</h2>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">After you have been working on the program for a period of time, you can use the survey to check if you have been delivering on the intentions you set at the start of the program.</p>
								<p className="hdng-18">These are some considerations in choosing when to do the survey, and how to manage the responses:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>You will typically not see much progress in hard, measurable performance in the first 3 to 4 months. After six months you should have some short-term wins and some changes in tools, behaviours and other deliverables from working with your team</li>
									<li>After 12 months there should be some key measurements or KPIs which you will have established, and these should start showing improvements in the business performance</li>
									<li>With a deeper understanding of what appropriate and excellent performance looks like, you might assess yourself lower than you did when you did not have the knowledge that you have been imparting to them</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">Taking all of this into account, we recommend that you have the original baseline assessment available, and compare the new results with the old ones. You could even use the baseline results as a prompt in the review by asking how much the you think you have improved the score since the baseline was done.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">If you ranked yourself excessively high in the initial baseline, you could also turn the question around and ask you would now rank yourself lower than you did at the time when you started the program.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Either way it is useful to show the improvement. Capturing the baseline and new scores in a spreadsheet is a powerful demonstration of the actual improvement.</p>
								<p className="hdng-18">The purpose of this exercise includes:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>Encouraging you to reflect on how much progress you have made and celebrating the wins</li>
									<li>Deciding which areas that you worked on are now good enough to run for a while, and picking the next priority areas to work on</li>
								</ul>
								<p className="hdng-16">TIP: The incremental benefit of doing more than 1 or 2 of these check-points is dependent on yourself. However, as the scores are subjective too many repeats could result in a “ticking-the-box” exercise which is not constructive.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">After 12-18 months you should have migrated to more meaningful objective KPIs, and you should have real hard data to support conversations about the next round of performance improvement initiatives.</p>

							<h2 className="hdng">Managing your learning program</h2>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">Most self-driven learning programs fail because of other priorities taking up available time, not getting help when you get stuck, or lack of accountability. We recommend that you find an accountability partner, consultant, coach or similar to help you with this.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Should you still decide to continue on your own, we recommend that you put some structures and habits in place to assist you in this journey. The tools and nature of these will be dependent on your own preferred ways of managing and prioritising work and deadlines.</p>
								<p className="hdng-18">Here are some tools that might be helpful to track progress:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>The goal setting tools in the learning portal</li>
									<li>A physical vision board and/or annual calendar that you put up on your office wall</li>
									<li>A paper based task management system such as post-it notes, bullet journals, diary</li>
									<li>Electronic systems ranging from simple task managers to complex project collaboration software platforms</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-18">The most important commitment you should make is to set aside time to work ON your business, as opposed to IN your business.</p>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-16">This program has 12 modules, each of which builds on the work from the previous one. It is therefore recommended that you do the modules in the sequence they are presented on the learning portal.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The first half of the program is fairly knowledge intensive and introduces many tools and concepts. There is also a lot of research and thinking required to get the information needed to build an irresistible offer. 2. The second half of the program revisits many of the concepts in the first half, and string them together into access to market strategies and offers. It also adds additional nuance to the concepts discovered in the first half of the program.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>NOTE:</b> Later modules often build on and revisit concepts from earlier modules, so it is important that you do the homework and continue to work on the outputs of previous modules.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Each of the modules comprise of a short video that goes through the presentation. It is critical that you watch this video.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">The first 6 modules on the portal has an additional tools document, which contain blank templates for you to use. You can also use templates or slides from the presentation to capture your work.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16"><b>TIP:</b>The program is highly focused on business growth through the use of marketing and sales tools, techniques and analysis. It should be said that no business will succeed without managing operations, people and cash effectively, no matter how attractive and effective their branding, marketing systems, processes and digital promotion engine and sales processes are.
									If the growth challenge does not lie in attracting and converting leads into sales, but in effective delivery of the value proposition and optimally capturing the created value, then this program is not suitable for your business, and you will be better served by a program such as the Business Builder.</p>

									<li>Organisational life cycle: the stages of growth as presented in Leaping the Chasm by Geoffrey Moore. Depending on the current state of your business, having a conversation with your team and your coach about the difference between innovators and early adopters vs mass market acceptance might unlock insights about the barriers to growth.</li>
									<li>Business model: The Business Model Canvas is covered in depth in other modules, and it is important for you to understand what the revenue and cost drivers for your company are, and what levers you could pull to increase it. This course focuses mainly on the right hand side of the canvas.</li>
									<li>Product market fit: four simple questions that all have to be “yes” for a business to succeed. A significant portion of startup businesses that fail do so because they do not have true product market fit.</li>
									<li>Sales conversion process: the underlying concept of a marketing / sales pipeline. It is sometimes useful to simplify the terms to demystify them and make them more accessible to your team. Marketing = building awareness and trust that leads to an enquiry. Sales = understanding the customer needs and matching those to the product or service that your company offers, or refering them somewhere else if you do not have the correct solution.</li>
									<li>Retention and growth: It is significantly cheaper in terms of time and resources to sell to return customers, compared to finding new customers if the nature of the product / service allows for recurring business. Most companies do not actively nurture or measure repeating and referring business.</li>
									<li>Profitable growth model: A reasonably comprehensive systems model of the growth process linking various components of the business model canvas, product market fit and marketing / sales process to data analytics and metrics and decision points.</li>

								<p className="hdng-16"><b>TIP: </b>Business owners sometimes think that the objective of cold calling or calling existing customers is to sell them something (get an order). It is more effective to set the purpose of an unsolicited call to a potential customer as geting time (attention) to discuss the product or solution, or to build a relationship.
									Calls to existing clients that have bought product from the company recently could be to ask for feedback on the product or service, checking if they need more of those, introducing new features or benefits and a myriad other reasons to talk to the customer.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">ANOTHER TIP: We highly recommend that you invest in basic sales skills training around making cold calls and pitching the company and its products / services for yourself and all staff who have sales as part of their role.</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">We also recommend preparing, scripting and rehearsing 30 second, 60 second and 5 minute cold call scripts, customer presentations, business networking introductions, trade show messages, product demonstration scripts and other verbal and physical presentation tools so that you and your sales team are ready for whichever opportunity you come across.</p>

								<p className="hdng-16">Given that many small businesses hope for increased access to corporate supply chains, it might be useful to do customer profiling when talking about proposal success (see the Business Builder module for more in-depth discussion and tools).</p>
								<p className="hdng-16">Of relevance is the idea that consumers typically have one person making the buying decision and using the product. On the other hand Corporates often have multiple people/roles involved in the buying decision. Understanding these roles will help you have the right discussions with the right person.</p>
							</div>

							<div className="tab-blocks">
								<p className="hdng-18">These roles are typically:</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>The person who understands the problem that the organisation is trying to solve,</li>
									<li>Technical buyers often work in operational functions such as Marketing, Logistics, Manufacturing and could be buying products or services (e.g. raw materials, transport, web design).</li>
									<li>They could also be working in support functions such as Facilities, Finance, Human Resources and are then more likely to look for outsourced or specialised services (e.g. audit, staff training)</li>
									<li>They are most likely to be interested in understanding your Value Proposition and how it is a better problem-solution fit than the competition.</li>
									<li>They have a major impact in including / excluding supplier products and services on the basis of fit-for-purpose, through the specifications they pass to Procurement</li>
									<li>They might influence the buying decision if there are clear differences between short term cost savings and longer term benefits from investing in more expensive products / service (the total cost of ownership or life-cycle cost conversations)</li>
									<li>Their objective is to get a fit-for-purpose solution that meets quality, safety and productivity requirements, and conversations with them should cover these topics, innovation and other topics that relate to the product and service.</li>

								<p className="hdng-18">Economic buyer (Procurement):</p>
								<ul className="site-ul">
									<li>In most corporates this function is done by either Finance or Procurement, and this is the person that makes the actual purchase decision and/or supplier selection</li>
									<li>They are likely to use procurement processes such as RFP (Request for Proposal), RFQ (Request for Quote), tendering, supplier selection and shortlisting and other supplier management processes</li>
									<li>They might be trained and incentivised in negotiation techniques which are aimed at reducing prices, and pose a major risk to your margins</li>
									<li>In the vast majority of cases their goal is to save the company money and they have little or no interest in product features and supplier performance other than meeting the minimum requirements determined by the technical buyer, although some more progressive Procurement officers would be looking at life-time cost-to-company and might be receptive to price vs quality and longevity proposals</li>
									<li>In most cases they have a compliance process to follow - it is imperative for you to understand where you might have room to propose alternate solutions, and other techniques for differentiating yourself from competitors in the procurement process.</li>
									<li>In more mature / advanced companies Procurement often have responsibility for measuring and enforcing Service Level Agreements (SLA) and would obtain quantitative and qualitative data from the End User in that case.</li>

								<p className="hdng-18">End User:</p>

									<li>They would be most interested in ease of use, fit for purpose, reliability and service</li>
									<li>End users typically have little or no role in the supplier selection decision, and they might often be the person placing the actual order for delivery to stock or operations.</li>
									<li>They might have inputs in determining and measuring Service Level Agreements (SLA) together with the technical buyer, and might able to influence the technical buyer or economic buyer on the basis of reliability, emergency service and other operational needs - it is imperative for you to understand their role and leverage it</li>
									<li>Also note that the end user is typically where the majority of the customer journey touchpoints are experienced, and where poor service can make or break your reputation and growth aspirations or lead to cancellation of your supply contract through Procurement.</li>
